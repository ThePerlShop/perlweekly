      "However I have another direction with this I'd like to understand how your workplaces relate to open source. Do they have any formal guidelines on how you can contribute to open source? Informal ones? What happens if you encounter a bug in an open source project you use? Are you allowed to contribute the fix back? On company time? Do they have a budget to support open source contributors who are not employees of the company? e.g. random Jane who works on some open source project? Please get in touch with me if you can share anything.",
