      "Most of you are probably on vacation and will get back to work at the beginning of January. I hope you'll have a better year than 2024 was. We, here in Israel, don't usually have vacation days at this time of the year, but this year the 8 days of Hanukkah started on December 25th. This means the schools are closed, the kids are on vacation and some people also take vacations days. We too had two days off.  On Thursday we visited the <a href=\"https://izrael.szabgab.com/hanuka-2024-2\">Dead Sea</a> and on Sunday we went to <a href=\"https://izrael.szabgab.com/hanuka-2024-5\">Tel Aviv</a>. I wrote about our visits in my personal blog in Hungarian. There are some pictures and some auto-translate might also help you with the text. I hope you also do some special things during your vacation time.",

On that page you can see both the previous presentations and the planned ones. You might notice that in most of the cases the planned events have a guest speaker. That's sort of my new year's resolution. I decided that starting from January I'll invite guest speakers. After all they have a lot more knowledge than I do.",
      "If you are interested in these virtual meetings and would like to get notified about them, join the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/\">Code Mavens Meetup group</a> that I use for the registration. There is one directly Perl-related <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/304874972/\">GitLab pipelines and CI for Perl developers</a> still by myself.",
      "The rest of the calendar still has lots of empty spaces for Perl-related presentations. If you are interested to give one, please <a href=\"https://szabgab.com/contact\">contact me</a>! It can be a presentation with slides and all the usual stuff, but it can also be a walk-through of some code-base (e.g. showing how something is implemented in a certain Perl module). It can also be something more pair-programming style where you show me how to do something in Perl. e.g. Show me how to build a web application with Mojolicious.
