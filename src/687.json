      "Hi there!",
      "Last week the <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/\">Weekly Challenge</a> was about <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-287/\">strong passwords</a>. This made me wonder <b>what is a strong password</b>? On some web sites the length of you password is limited. (e.g. max 8 characters) which seems to me an indication that the developers have no clue about password security. Actually worse than that. It makes me worry that the site keeps the password as clear text in the database and the field size was set to that number. (e.g. 8 characters). Some places don't allow you to include spaces which make me wonder if they are constructing their database INSERT statement using string concatenation opening themselves to <a href=\"https://bobby-tables.com/\">SQL injection attacks</a>.",
      "On many web sites you are required to use both upper and lowercase letters, digits and symbols. The symbols being a subset of the characters having the decimal ASCII code 32-47, 58-64, 91-96, 126. That is up to 30 different characters. The letters are 2*26 characters and the digits are the 10 different digits. The number of possibilities using letters and digits only is (26*2 + 10)^n  and if we include all the symbols as well then it is (26*2 + 10 + 30)^n for a password of n characters. If I am not mistaken with this and with the calculations, this means that a 7-character password using [a-zA-Z0-9] has more variety than a 6-character password that also includes symbols. In other words having a longer password makes your password much stronger than including symbols as well.  As far as I understand having 15-charcter password using only letters and spaces would make my password much stronger than having an 8-character password using all 92 characters.",
      "So I tend to use sentences that make sense to me or quotes from poems or from song lyrics as passwords. That makes it much easier to remember them and - if I am not mistaken - harder to find by an attacker.",
      "What do you think?",
      "In other news Adam Russell, Brett Estrade, and Christos Argyropoulos are trying to get the word out about the <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2024/09/perl-community-conference-science-perl-journal-winter-2024-call-for-papers-now-open-deadline-930.html\">Perl Community Conference / Science Perl Journal</a> Winter 2024 CALL FOR PAPERS NOW OPEN!
