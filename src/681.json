Watch the video, click on thumbs up, and follow the channel! If you are looking for more real-world examples check out the listings on the <a href=\"https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/\">CPAN Digger</a>. There you can see which CPAN distribution has GitHub Actions configured and which one does not. You can look at the <a href=\"https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/recent\">recently uploaded distributions</a> or the <a href=\"https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/river\">most central distributions</a> or the distributions <a href=\"https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/author/\">by author</a>.",
      "The next event will be in 3 days about <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301871765/\">GitHub Pages for Perl developers</a>. We will start creating a simple static site using just Markdown and no Perl. Then we'll see a few examples how to build web sites on Github pages using Perl. Among the examples we'll see how the web site of the <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/\">Perl Weekly</a> and <a href=\"https://perl.theplanetarium.org/\">The Perl Planetarium</a> are generated. We'll also take a look at some other sites, such as <a href=\"https://kantoniko.com/\">Kantoniko</a>, the Ladino (aka. Judaeo Spanish) dictionary I have been working on. It is using Python, but the same concept could have been implemented in Perl as well. <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301871765/\">Join us live</a>, ask questions, and get started immediately!",
