      "Hi there,",
      "I noticed recently the videos of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDtghjWTaH3CMKDYXcMhCMCNDekVq9iK\">25th German Perl Workshop</a> made public. It reminded me sweet and pleasant memory when I first attended the <strong>20th German Perl Workshop</strong>. It was my first ever <strong>Perl Workshop</strong> outside of <strong>London</strong>. I still don't know why I decided to attend it, knowing <strong>German</strong> is going to be the main language. The best part of the <strong>GPW 2018</strong> was that I never felt outsider during the 3 days event. Infact, at one point, I was attending a talk in <strong>German</strong>, a friend of mine, <strong>Julien Fiegehenn</strong>, sitting next to me translating the talk realtime for me. I even received a <strong>Perl</strong> book in <stron>German</strong> after team dinner one evening. I made many new friends during the event. I even shared the <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2018/04/20th-german-perl-workshop---report.html\">event report</a>. I still go back read it when I feel low.",
      "<strong>Why am I talking about it now?</strong>",
      "In the last edition, <strong>Gabor Szabo</strong> mentioned <a href=\"https://perlweekly.com/archive/639.html\">Standards of Conduct</a>.I was planning to attend <a href=\"https://perlconference.us/tprc-2022-hou/\">The Perl and Raku Conference 2022</a> but then dropped the idea as it was held in <strong>Houston, TX</strong>. There was nothing wrong with the location as such. I felt little uncomfortable visiting <strong>USA</strong> being a practising muslim. I decided to wait until it goes to <strong>Canada</strong>. My wish came true the following year as the venue was <strong>Toronto</strong>. I finally got the opportunity to attend it at last. I had a great time and met many big names. Having attended the conference in <strong>Toronto</strong>, now I feel confident to attend the next conference in <a href=\"https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las/\">Las Vegas</a>. If everything goes as per plan then I would even take my family as well.",
      "<strong>How about London Perl Workshop?</strong>",
      "Being member of organising committee of <strong>LPW</strong>, I know it is not happing this year. I really miss it badly. I hope and pray it is back next year. It is not that we never talk about it. We do discuss but nothing has materialised so far. Traditionally, it is one day event, so it shouldn't be hard to get decent crowd. The last time we organised was in the <a href=\"http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2019/\">year 2019</a>. There was a <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2022/09/london-perl-workshop-status-update-2023.html\">blog post</a> last year with regard to the status of <strong>LPW</strong>.",
      "<strong>How about Perl Advent Calendar this year?</strong>",
      "I am so happy to see the preparation for this year is going with full speed. I missed the train last year because of lack of time. But this year, I have booked a slot for myself. If you are interested to contribute then please do <a href=\"https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent\">checkout</a> the source. Talking about <strong>Advent Calendar</strong>, there is a <a href=\"https://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/\">Advent Planet</a> run by <strong>Len Jaffe</strong>. If you run <strong>Advent Calendar</strong> then do share the details with him. I did share <a hrf=\"https://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/2021/index.html\">Weekly Challenge Advent Calendar 2021</a> but looks like I forgot to share <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2022/\">Advent Calendar 2022</a> with him. This time, I will make sure it gets space in the <strong>Planet Advent</strong>.",
      "<strong>Jason Crome</strong> recently announced <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/jason_a_crome/2023/10/dancer-advent-calendar-2023.html\">Dancer Advent Calendar 2023</a>. I have <a href=\"https://advent.perldancer.org/2018/15\">contributed in the past</a> but this year, unfortunately I will miss it.",
      "Today is the last day for <strong>Hacktoberfest 2023</strong>. Did you take part in the event? If yes then please do share with us. Last but not the least, please do remember in prayers all those who suffer in the recent conflict in <strong>Gaza</strong>. By the way, this is my <strong>140th issue</strong>. Enjoy rest of the newsletter."
