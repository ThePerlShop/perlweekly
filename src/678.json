I am happy to see the return of <strong>Philip Bruhat</strong> and <strong>Graham Knop</strong> to the fold alongwith the new member <strong>Aristotle Pagaltzis</strong>. I would like to take this opportunity to thank, <strong>Paul Evans</strong> for the quality contributions. Thanks to the <strong>PSC</strong>, we get regular updates about the work being carried out.

If you checkout the changes in the last two releases, you will find mostly updates to <strong>Modules</strong> and <strong>Pragmata</strong>. For me, the most significant change is the addition of <strong>chdir</strong> as a subroutine to the <strong>CORE::</strong> namespace.",

I started watching but couldn't finish it as I lost the interest halfway through. I have bookmarked it for now, will come back soon. If you are looking for cool one-liners in <strong>Perl</strong> or <strong>Raku</strong> then I would highly recommend the contributions by the <strong>Team PWC</strong> down below under the section <stromg>The Weekly Challenge</stromg>.",
