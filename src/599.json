      "Recently I started to offer a course called <a href=\"https://osdc.code-maven.com/\">Open Source Development Course</a>. The idea is to let participants learn and practice(!) git/github/pull-request/testing/code-coverage/linters/ci/etc. That way they improve their development practices and can also contribute to Open Source projects.",
      "It is a course designed to run for 12-13 weeks with about 5 hours per week workload. It can be either part of a university program or people can take it while they have a full-time job. Every week there is a 1-2 hours long presentation and the rest is hands-on work with my async help.",
      "I'd like to offer a version of this course especially for people who are interested in contributing to Perl-based Open Source projects. The participants will learn Perl-specific tools and processes. All proceedings will go to sponsor the <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/users/book/2023/01/the-perl-toolchain-summit-is-back-in-2023.html\">The Perl Toolchain Summit</a>. If calculated well, we'll be done with the course just before the PTS starts.",
