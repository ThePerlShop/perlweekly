      "The <strong>Advent Calendar</strong> celebration begins with the start of <strong>December</strong>. For all <strong>Perl</strong> fans, we have <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2022\">Perl Advent Calendar 2022</a>, thanks to the hard work of <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> and his team. I am sure you have checked out the amazing daily source of fun.",
      "As of today, we have got through <strong>12 days</strong>.",
      "<strong>Do you have any favourite so far?</strong>",
      "Well I do have mine. To me the best part is the festive flavour in every article. I find it amusing and fun to read the story. I have contributed in the past but never got around to add the spice. I would blame the lack of background knowledge. This year's calendar started with <strong>Toby Inkster</strong> creation <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-01.html\">Silent Mite</a>. What a cool way to start the calendar. If you look at closely all the contributions so far, you would notice a fresh air with lots of positive energy. One name stands out very prominently this year is <strong>Thibault DUPONCHELLE</strong>. His first contribution, <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-03.html\">Santa is on GitHub</a> was a nice way to begin the journey. Then found a gem from a very dear friend of mine, <strong>Julien Fiegehenn</strong> talking about good old friend <strong>CGI</strong>. In fact, I have seen him presenting the subject <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-04.html\">northpole.cgi</a> at the <strong>Perl Conference</strong>. I found another piece of work by <strong>Thibault DUPONCHELLE</strong> about <strong>MongoDB</strong>. I found the <strong>Day 5</strong> contribution <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-05.html\">Catching dreams</a> is worth checking, if you want to explore <strong>MongoDB</strong>. If I am not mistaken then few years ago, <strong>Dave Cross</strong> shared his creation <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/SVG::ChristmasTree\">SVG::ChristmasTree</a> in <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong>. I was happy to see it part of this year calendar too, not directly though. <strong>Day 8</strong> started with <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-08.html\">A Perlmas Tree</a> by <strong>Maximilian Lika</strong>. I found <strong>Day 11</strong> contribution very technical dealing with <strong>signal ALRM</strong>. Not an easy subject to discuss in the <strong>Advent Calendar</strong> in my humble opinion. Thanks <strong>OODLER</strong> for the fine contribution, <a href=\"https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-11.html\">Wake up! Time to open presents!</a>.",
      "If you are still looking for more <strong>Advent Calendar</strong> theme fun then I would highly recommend, <a href=\"https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2022\">The Weekly Challenge Advent Calendar</a>. Like in the past, this year also, it has contributions from <strong>Team PWC</strong> hand picked by me. I am sure you would find it interesting.",
      "I am working on something that I would love to be part of this year <strong>Perl Advent Calendar</strong>. Hopefully it would be ready soon. Well I am also working on something similar for <strong>Raku Advent Calendar</strong>. It would be an achievement if I can get both done on time. Please wish me luck.",
