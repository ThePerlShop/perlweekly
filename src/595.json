As for me, I publish about a lot of things, not only Perl and I put most of them in series. I have a steady number or readers and the number of followers is also growing nicely. There are more than 400 already. If you too are interested about the subjects I write about <a href=\"https://dev.to/szabgab/\">follow me on DEV</a>.",
