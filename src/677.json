      "First time I taught Perl was in the year 2000. It was one of the local training companies that hired me, gave me their teaching material, and sent me in the classroom. I remember standing in front of the class for some time that felt ages without any clue what to say. Then somehow I started to speak. Apparently the course went well enough as they asked me to teach again. Since then a lot has happened. I created my own training materials. I started to offer my courses directly to the clients, and I taught Perl to more than a 1,000 people. Both in Israel and in some other countries. It was really nice. It let me travel to Perl conferences and workshops around the world and meet nice people. Unfortunately there are hardly any Perl training courses these days and unless there are some major changes in the language I don't expect this to change.",
      "I am mentioning this because this week is the first time I am teaching an in-person Rust course. Interestingly, to a bunch of Python programmers who are switching from Python to Rust. I am both nervous and excited. I am excited as I love learning and the explaining new technologies and there is a lot to learn in Rust. There is also more to teach in Rust as it is much harder to learn than Perl or Python.",
