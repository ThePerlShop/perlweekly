The rant was on why Perl is dying. Basically Ovid says that Perl lags behind the more popular languages adopting new features. Including features that were available to some other languages 10-20-40 years ago. Predictably some people jumped on blaming the Perl 6 effort. Others pointed out the lack of volunteers. The lack of outreach. The missing modules from the standard libraries.",
