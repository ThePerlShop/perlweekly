      "A couple of weeks ago I received an email full of good old antisemitism. It was clearly indicating that it is from one of the readers of the Perl Weekly. It was a tirade of expressions common to white Christian antisemites. Usually also referred to as white supremacists. It is clear that the sender knew what he was doing was reprehensible as he tried to hide behind an anonymous address. However, I am not sure what he wanted to achieve with this message. I guess he was upset that he cannot physically harm me. This person is also a bit slow. He found out that I am a Jew only now and I definitely did not hide this fact. I wonder what will happen when he understands that the other editor is a Muslim. These white supremacists usually hate them too.",
      "This past week was the International Holocaust Remembrance day. Both of my parents went through the Holocaust, but at the end they were among the few lucky ones who survived. My father was born in 1917 so he was well aware of the pre-Holocaust rhetoric. I am quite sure he would be shocked by the level of Jew-hatred that goes on the social networks and in the public sphere in general. More or less with impunity. Both from the right and from the left.",
      "After WWII many Germans said they did not know what was happening. Now we can see what's going on. Unfortunately most people try not to look and don't speak up. They might be afraid to speak up. If they do speak up they usually point to the other side of the political aisle and it gets tagged as partisan politics. The growing anti-Jewish public expressions bother me a lot, but what bothers me even more is that the majority is silent.",

      "OK, now that I got this off my chest, let me mention the <a href=\"https://osdc.code-maven.com/\"><b>Open source development course</b></a> I started to teach last week.
