      "Hi there,",
      "The <strong>London Perl and Raku Conference 2024</strong> finally happened last Saturday 26th October. It was a pleasant morning to start the day. I happened to arrive a bit early at the venue and met <strong>Paul Evans</strong> as he was going through the slides of his upcoming talks. It was nice to have a one-on-one conversation with him. For the first time in many years of attending <strong>LPW</strong>, I finally mustered the courage to break the ice.",
      "Soon we all gathered in the main hall for the welcome presentation by <strong>Julien</strong>. I stayed in the same room for the most anticipated talk, <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7904\">Perl in 2030</a> by <strong>Paul Evans</strong>. As expected it was an engaging presentation about the future of <strong>Perl</strong>. This was followed by another interesting talk, <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7907\">Cloudy Perl, how it looks now</a> by <strong>Dave Lambley</strong>. We took a break from technical talks for a quick presentation by <strong>Stuart Mackintosh</strong> who shared how <strong>TPRF</strong> is working towards the development of <strong>Perl</strong> and <strong>Raku</strong>. I had the honour of speaking to him afterward, thanking him for all the work <strong>TPRF</strong> is doing to bring the language back on track.",
      "Unfortunately I missed the talk, <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7889\">Perl Diver</a> by <strong>Dave Cross</strong> as it clashed with <strong>Paul Evans</strong> presentation. I am hoping to watch the video when it becomes available. I met so many friends after a long time, thanks to <strong>LPW 2024</strong>. I missed <strong>Neil Bowers</strong> and <strong>Lance Wicks</strong> very much but I was pleasantly surprised to meet <strong>Sawyer</strong>, <strong>Olaf Alders</strong> and <strong>Paul Cochrane</strong>. We spent quality time together.",
      "After lunch, it was my turn present, <a href=\"https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7900\">What's new in Perl v5.40?</a>. It was well attended, and <strong>Paul Evans</strong> made it even more special by sitting in the front row. I mostly stayed in the main hall for the rest of the talks and look forward to the recordings being available soon.",
      "I had planned to attend the post workshop social but decided to skip it at the last minute as I wasn't feeling well. I am sure those who attended had a great time. I hope to see you all again around this time next year.",
      "Last but not least I would like to encourage you to submit your proposal for the <strong>Perl Advent Calendar 2024</strong>. You can find more information <a href=\"https://cfp.perladvent.org\">here</a>.",
      "Enjoy rest of the newsletter and please take extra care of yourself."
