      "Hi,",
      "A month from now Randal Schwartz is going to give a presentation with the title \"Half My Life with Perl\". I tried to come up with a clever title for this issue of the newsletter that would reflect that title and I had to realize that I have been using Perl also for half of my life. It is probably similar for quite a lot of people in the hard-core of the Perl communities. Many have moved on to other languages. Some of those still have a nostalgic feeling for their 'first love' in the 'good old days'.",
      "It is sad to see the decline in popularity. I remember the time when we had several conferences and workshops every year and hundreds of active <a href=\"https://www.pm.org/\">Perl Monger groups</a> with tens of monthly meetings around the world. Long before Meetup became a thing. Now there are only 18 groups listed and seeing the list of events at the bottom of this newsletter it seems only 3 or 4 are active.",
      "The readership of this newsletter has also declined from a peak of 6,443 subscribers in May 2018 to 4,398 today.",
      "But not all is lost. There are still people working on Perl as you can see from the grants. There are still people uploading libraries to CPAN as you can see from the <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/recent\">recent</a> report. There are still some people writing about Perl. There are still some companies using Perl.",
      "Have a nice week!"
