      "Analogies can be very useful to describe a lesser known thing by some commonly known thing, but if your readers don't know what is the dying Pontiac then maybe it is mostly confusing. For example I immediately thought about two things: the famous cruiser the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_battleship_Potemkin\">Potemkin</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River\">Potomac river<a>. Neither of those seem to be related. Apparently the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_(automobile)\">Pontiac</a> is a car brand primarily sold in North America. You can also search for <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=dying+pontiac&ia=web\">dying Pontiac</a>, but after seeing the results I got really confused.",

I recommend you read them.",
      "On a somewhat related topic the results of the 2024 <a href=\"https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/\">Stack Overflow Survey</a> were published. Perl is pretty low on the popularity list. Which ties back to the discussion. Is it important (for you) that the technology you use is popular? Does it have an impact on your ability to do whatever you want to or have to do? For example for me it is important as I mostly teach the technologies.",
      "Let me use this opportunity to mention that in the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/\">Code Mavens</a> Meetup group I organize virtual presentations mostly about Rust, Python, and Perl. You are invited to join the group and join some of the live presentations.",
