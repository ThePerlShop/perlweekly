      "In 1492 the Jews were <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-spanish-expulsion-1492\">expelled from Spain</a> and 4 years later also from Portugal. Many of those Jews settled in the Ottoman Empire and kept talking and changing their language. This is what created the language we call 'Judeo-Espanyol' or in its modern name 'Ladino'. For 500 years these people kept speaking and improving their language which is now a mix of medieval Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Turkish, Greek, Italian, Hebrew, Arabic, and probably a few other languages. These Jews are usually referred to as the 'Sephardic' Jews because 'Sepharad' means Spain in Hebrew. It was originally written using old Hebrew letters called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi_script\">Rashi</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitreo\">Solitreo</a>, but in the last 100 years or so it was switched to Latin letters.",
      "Unfortunately due to various reasons (The modernization of Turkey by Atatürk, the Holocaust, emigration to USA, Israel and elsewhere) the majority of remaining Ladino speakers switched to the local language and today there are only a few ten thousands of native Ladino speakers, most of them above 60.",
      "There are various grass-root projects to revitalize the language. One of them is called <a href=\"https://kantoniko.com/\">Kantoniko</a>. It is a multi-lingual dictionary with sample sentences, audio, poster etc. There are also experiments to use the material for educational purposes for people who would like to learn Ladino. The project has some Open Source code written in Python and JavaScript. There is also a lot of data under various Creative-Commons licenses.",
      "I know Python is not your cup of tea, but the whole project might be interesting to some of you and might take a look at it. I recorded a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw7UYp3N0eUYt8ARGB4DbNffB4MPROFDY\">series of videos in English</a> about the site and how to contribute to it.",
