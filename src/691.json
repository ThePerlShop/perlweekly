If you are ready to spend a few minutes on it, you could go to the GitHub repository of <a href=\"https://github.com/Perl/perl5\">perl</a> and the CPAN libraries you use and you could add a star to each one them. This is a rather small task. It won't have a huge impact either, but many small things add up.",

See for example the 'Repository' link of the <a href=\"https://metacpan.org/pod/URI\">URI</a> distribution.",
      "Some modules don't have the 'Repository' link. One of the goals of the <a href=\"https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/\">CPAN Digger</a> project is to encourage people to add this information to their projects. You could help with that too so it will be easier for the next person to find the repository.",
