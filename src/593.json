      "Hi there!",
      "I registered to <a href=\"https://dev.to/\">DEV.to</a> in 2017, more than 5 years ago. Posted a few articles with rather limited success: less than 10 people looked at the articles. Then in 2020 I posted a few more articles. On one of them (<a href=\"https://dev.to/szabgab/tests-are-awesome-3i63\">Tests are awesome!</a> I got as many as 300 readers, but the others have not received much love so I did not continue publishing. In 2021 I had another experiment when I published <a href=\"https://dev.to/szabgab/perl-modules-with-their-own-web-site-2gmo\">Perl modules with their own web site</a> on which there were some 600 visitors. Primarily the readers of the Perl Weekly newsletter. I published a few more articles with readers in the low 10s. A few weeks ago I started to publish again. This time several of my articles got above 100 viewers and one, <a href=\"https://dev.to/szabgab/open-source-development-courses-5d4b\">Open Source Development Courses</a> is already above 1100 viewers. I regularly get around 600 readers a day.",
      "There were a couple of changes: 1. There are more people on DEV. 2. I publish a lot more articles that appeal to a wider range of people. 3. There is a sort-of network effect. The more people up-vote and bookmark (the two kinds of reactions on DEV) my articles the more people will see it.",
      "The nice thing about DEV is that I can republish the articles I published elsewhere (e.g. on <a href=\"https://perlmaven.com/\">PerlMaven</a>, on <a href=\"https://code-maven.com/\">Code-Maven</a>, or <a href=\"https://blogs.perl.org/\">blogs.perl.org</a>, and also I can set the canonical URL of each article on DEV to the original one on my blog. That way I get the visitors on DEV as well, but the 'Google juice' the articles receive will flow over to my sites. It seems like a win-win for DEV and authors who have blogs elsewhere. You can even configure DEV to pull your RSS feed and create drafts from your articles published elsewhere. I even started to republish the content of the <a href=\"https://dev.to/szabgab/perl-weekly-591-less-than-50-use-ci-4966\">Perl Weekly</a>.",
      "So here is what I suggest. If you already write about Perl elsewhere, republish those articles on DEV and tag them with <b>perl</b>. If you are primarily a reader of articles, then register on <a href=\"https://dev.to/\">DEV</a> and start up-voting the <a href=\"https://dev.to/t/perl\">Perl-related posts</a> you like. You can even follow a few authors there, get notified when they have new posts, and up-vote those to encourage them to write even more.",
      "Alternatively, you can watch the <a href=\"https://perl.theplanetarium.org/\">Perl Planetarium</a>. It already follows the <b>perl</b> tag on DEV.",
      "Enjoy your week!"
