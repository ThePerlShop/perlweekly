Are they legally required to publish anything that has the word 'Perl' in it even if the person submitting it has no track record with Perl and the Perl community? Do they really believe that a person who has never contributed to Perl from a place that has not seen any Perl contribution will out of the blue run a Perl Hackathon? Or is this a political agenda?",
