      "This was my response: To respond to your questions: I personally was using Dancer a lot, but  Mojolicious seems to have slightly more development activity.<br>For CI I use either GitHub Actions or GitLab pipelines depending on which git hosting service the project uses.<br>I rent a server at <a href=\"https://www.linode.com/\">Linode</a>, but I have converted many of my sites to be static using some Static Site Generator and then I host them on GitHub pages.",
