<title>Thought-Leader Wanted. Chief Software Architect Role</title>
<link>https://job.perl.careers/euq</link>
<description>In an ideal world, you&#x2019;ll be on-site in Malaysia. Malta or Dubai would do in a pinch as this global company has offices there, too. However, if you&#x2019;re reading this from Cairo or Buenos Aires and think you&#x2019;re the star candidate they&#x2019;re looking for, you&#x2019;re not out of the running. Our client knows the value of a strong leader and even if you&#x2019;re located outside their preferred places.</description>

<title>CPAN Module Tutorials</title>
<link>https://dev.to/davorg/cpan-module-tutorials-2be9</link>
<description>Dave started to create a list of tutorials for CPAN modules with the idea to link to them from MetaCPAN. Excellent idea. I hope it will be integrated into MetaCPAN and won&#x27;t be a separate web site. And if it is a separate website I&#x27;d probably just use GitHub pages. See also &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/ut2u91/linking_cpan_modules_with_tutorials/&#x22;&#x3E;Reddit&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.</description>

<description>&#x27;As any average Perl hacker, ...&#x27; Flavio opens his post. On the second reading I understood that he means that many Perl hackers do it, but first I thought he think of himself as being average. If that was the case, Perl would not be declining and we would have so many articles for the Perl weekly that we would not be able to include even 10% of them. Anyway, who does not want to maintain a templating system?</description>

<title>#565 - Supporting the Perl Weekly</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/565.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two weeks ago I wrote about the issues we are facing with the Perl Weekly. I got a lot of responses and then yesterday I also noticed there were quite few comments on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/unb6yd/do_you_want_the_perl_weekly_to_continue/&#x22;&#x3E;Reddit&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as well. Let me thank all the responses now.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Many people suggested that we could switch to sending out every 2 weeks or once a month, but I don&#x27;t think either of those would be a good idea. Some people suggested we (Mohammad and myself) should write more articles or interview people. Well, no. The Perl Weekly is specifically about collecting &#x3C;b&#x3E;your&#x3C;/b&#x3E; content and sharing it. So it is the wider Perl community that could solve the content-problem by writing more articles. Which brings me to one of our posts today. Dave Cross had another nice idea, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/davorg/cpan-module-tutorials-2be9&#x22;&#x3E;linking to tutorials of CPAN modules from MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. You don&#x27;t need to write some article on a topic that has never been mentioned. It would be enough to take one of the modules you use anyway. Put together an example on how to use it. Add some explanations and then post it on your blog. (Which could be very simple using GitHub pages.) Send us the link and also include it in the CSV file of Dave.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some people suggested to have a (better) web version and RSS feed. You are welcome to send a PR changing the web version to be better. The source of the Perl Weekly is &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. We also have two different RSS feeds: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/perlweekly.rss&#x22;&#x3E;latest edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/index.rss&#x22;&#x3E;10 most recent editions&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. However these get updated only once a week. If you really like RSS, you might want to use the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.theplanetarium.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Planetarium&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by who else, Dave Cross.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There was some back-and-forth on Reddit whether the Perl-related Facebook groups are the best thing on earth or the worst thing on Earth. I think both sides are right. On one hand Facebook is a black hole that anything going there is invisible from the outside world - that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t often link to it. On the other hand the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Community&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl programmers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Facebook groups seem to be the most active locations for discussing anything about Perl. So let&#x27;s thank those Perl Mongers who spend time in these groups helping the newcomers. If I may suggest something, if you are not doing it yet: You could also try to direct them to the Perl Weekly and you could also work with them to set up a public blog (or use &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/t/perl&#x22;&#x3E;dev.to&#x3C;/a&#x3E;) and write a post about something Perl related.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally, some people suggested to ask for a grant from The Perl Foundation. Here is the thing. Money in itself is not an issue, but feeling that the work we do is appreciated goes a long way. The many responses I got show that there are at least a few people who value our work. Thank you!. However, if the issue of money was already raised you could use some money to show your appreciation. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;Mohammad S Anwar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; has Patreon account with currently 23 supporters. Can we double this number? I also have a Patreon account, but for me a much better boost would be if you checked out the web-site of my son and became a user and a paying subscriber. It is called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://torto.ai/welcome?utm_source=perlweekly&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_campaign=perlweekly565&#x22;&#x3E;torto.ai&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. That will make me a lot happier than any money you might send to my Patreon account.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So that&#x27;s about it for now.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
