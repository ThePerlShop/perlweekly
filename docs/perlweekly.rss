<title>No One Is Immune to Abuse</title>
<link>https://blogs.perl.org/users/oldtechaa/2023/07/no-one-is-immune-to-abuse.html</link>
<description>I watched the presentation of Sawyer, and then the QA. One thing I can tell, that when I received abuse in public, what really hurt was that I did not see (enough) people publicly standing up for me. Not even with a down-vote of the abusing post (e.g. Reddit). Besides hurting me, I think this also hurts the community a lot. People watching these forums seeing the abuse that goes unchallenged will much less likely to get involved in the community.</description>

<title>#627 - Rust is fun</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/627.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;You might know that for many years I provided Perl training to corporations, both here in Israel and overseas. Unfortunately there are hardly any Perl courses these days. Three years ago I had a client from Switzerland that wanted to have a mix of training and consulting on testing their perl-based code. Another client from Germany wanted me to analyze their code-base and give them recommendations on how to modernize their code-base. There were a few others who reached out to me, but none of them were testing-related and none talked about training. I recommended them to contact some of the other people who do Perl consulting.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not the only one who mostly lost their perl-related income. Some still stick around the Perl community maybe writing some Perl for fun, but they had to find other sources of income. Some people moved away from hi-tech altogether others moved to non-programming positions, and others learned other languages. For some time Ruby was a big winner of ex Perl developers, but it has been declining for years. Python had an appeal too, but they created so much animosity towards Perl, that switching over had an emotional toll. In a way Go (Golang) was an easier choice as it is so different from Perl. Then came Rust.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So what shall I do now? I asked myself a couple of years ago when I noticed that my Perl-related income has almost totally vanished. I still ask it now as I have not really found a &#x27;home&#x27;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It took me quite a while to pick up Python, but eventually I started to write a lot of code and started teach it too. It is going quite well. However, despite even helping with the organization of several Python conferences, I never felt part of the Python community.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Recently I picked up Rust and I went all in. I started to work on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rust-digger.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Rust Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; which is similar to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I already uploaded my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rustatic.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;first crate&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and I even started to run my first experimental Rust course (in Hebrew). I was quite happy to see the presentation of Dave Rolsy: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBsEF-anSLY&#x22;&#x3E;Why Do Programmers Love Rust?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. That gave me further motivation.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So now I am thinking to offer another, still experimental Rust course. This time in English. Probably starting in September. It will be Zoom-based; 2-3 hours a meeting in the morning hours of USA, late afternoon in Europe; running for a few weeks. It will cost a few hundred USD/EUR. The exact details will be determined later. For now I&#x27;d like to see if there is an interest attending it. So if you feel you&#x27;d like to participate let me know. Without any obligation to actually participate.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a good your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
