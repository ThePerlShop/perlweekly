<title>#572 - Perl Blogger?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/572.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Are you a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; blogger?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The state of Perl blogging is not hidden from anyone. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; wrote an extensive &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2020/09/blogging-for-perl&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; explaining not just the issues but also suggestions to get around it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I proposed an idea on my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/cpan_author&#x22;&#x3E;personal twitter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; handle and asked for public opinion. As of today, it got &#x3C;strong&#x3E;22 likes&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I know, it isn&#x27;t big number.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;By the way, what was the proposal?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The proposal was to setup dedicated domain (https) powered by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub Pages&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The static site would be generated by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hugo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It would be open to public to submit blog post as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Markdown&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; formatted page as pull request. After a quick review, the post would be live.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sounds simple, isn&#x27;t it?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The proposal should be familiar to those who have ever wrote an article for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com&#x22;&#x3E;Perl.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It has the same the process as I mentioned above, I was reminded the same in response to my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Twitter post&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by a friend of mine. It makes me sad to see that the last post on the site was published on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;25th May 2021&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I came to know about the site for the first time when I found out about the monthly post &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;What&#x27;s new on CPAN&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;David Farrell&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. In the early days of my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; association, every time I upload a new distribution, I would wait for the article to see if my distribution made it or not. Some of my distributions did appear in the article, just for record. I even did interview series, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl Ambassador&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for the site in the year 2020. I had the honour to interview, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-gabor-szabo&#x22;&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-curtis-poe&#x22;&#x3E;Curtis &#x27;Ovid&#x27; Poe&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-damian-conway&#x22;&#x3E;Damian Conway&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. What a shame, I couldn&#x27;t continue even though I had the list of high profile &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Ambassadors&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to interview.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have mostly blogged on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar&#x22;&#x3E;blogs.perl.org&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I don&#x27;t consider myself an active blogger, although I used to blog frequently before. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable now a days blogging on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;bpo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, so I decided to blog on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and cross linked on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;bpo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It is (cross linking) something not approved by many as I understand. I am likely to setup my personal blog site instead, just for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I will share the details when it is live. You are all welcome to contribute.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am up for new ideas and suggestions too. Please do share if you have one.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#571 - Sponsoring TPF or individuals</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/571.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What if you had a steady income of a few thousand USDs just for doing awesome things for Perl so you can afford to do whatever you want? I bet there would be tons of things you could do. Improving CPAN modules, patching Perl, writing articles, recording videos, encouraging others to write more. etc.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So what if we could support a few people to do just that? How could you be part of it? You could &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlfoundation.org/donate&#x22;&#x3E;donate to TPF&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but for you, as an individual it might be better to support an individual directly. Without the organizational overhead. For this a while ago I put together the list of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/supporting-perl-creators&#x22;&#x3E;all the Perl-related people&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I knew about at that time, who are accepting donations. They are mostly looking for monthly support instead of a one-time support. In my opinion it is much better to support someone with $10/month than $200 one-time donation. Partially because having a steady income is much better than having the need to raise more funds every few weeks or even every few months. With that said both at Patreon and GitHub Sponsors you can subscribe to a regular donation and then, after the payment you can cancel it. Effectively providing a one-time donation.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I went over the list now. There are 11 people listed on that page with a total of 139 sponsors. (There is probably some overlap the same person sponsoring more than one &#x27;creator&#x27;.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Personally I&#x27;d recommend you &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;sponsor the work of Mohammad&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as he both creates code and generates a lot of publicity for Perl, but if you decide to support someone else from the list that&#x27;s awesome too. If you find donate to someone who is not in this list yet, and if they agree, feel free to send a PR to add them to the list.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#570 - CPAN Weekly</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/570.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I noticed a fresh air and renewed energy among &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Hackers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; ever since the latest release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I can only imagine what would be the reaction when &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; becomes part of core Perl. It would definitely help &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; regain its glory, in my humble opinion.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As some of you are aware that I have been doing daily &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; feature series for sometimes now, I have seen so much interest in the new/improved features brought in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. All credit goes to the hard work and dedication of the team responsible for the release. I have got all the daily feature posts saved in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for anyone to checkout. I am pleasantly surprised to see the repository quicky getting to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Top 3&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; popular repostories on my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;GotHub dashboard&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you remember &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://cpan-weekly.org&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Weekly&#x3C;/a&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was created and managed by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I still remember the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2016/02/cpan-weekly-one-module-per-week-in-your-inbox.html&#x22;&#x3E;public announcement&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I really enjoyed the weekly email. I still have it saved in my email inbox. It is priceless treasure that I don&#x27;t want to loose. So I decided to drop a line on my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/cpan_author&#x22;&#x3E;twitter handle&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, asking shouldn&#x27;t it get a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;reboot&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I got plenty of support for the reboot. Even &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; responded with a warning, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;resist the temptation of do it myself, instead encourage others to take it on&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Who knows my workload better than me. I knew if I wanted to do this just by myself then it would be hard to justify the legacy started by original creator, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was lucky to find a helping hand in no time. She is also member of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I have seen her growth ever since she joined the team. I am lucky to have her in the team. She responded with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 emails&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; so far detailing her thought process. It is still in early discussion stage, I will share more details when we have initial draft ready. We are not in a rush, to be honest. The more help I get the better it is going to be.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;One more thing, I would like to talk about recently concluded, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlconference.us/tprc-2022-hou/schedule&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in Houston&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I really wanted to attend in person and meet everyone. I missed the live streaming of the talks. Never mind, we now have all the talks recorded. Please go and pick your favourite one from the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFyOpb-U3DMU7OT93dPUdtpE&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube Playlist&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I would like to mention couple, I have seen so far from the list that I loved it and they are &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH5IyYyvWHU&#x22;&#x3E;Taming the Unicode Beast&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lSdBSCkFGs&#x22;&#x3E;Corinna Status, 2022&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. When I have spare time, I will definitely go through each one by one.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not sure about others but I miss event reports by the attendees of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; conference. I remember, in good old days, we would get plenty of such event reports. It used to give nice perspective from the attendee point of view. I wish and hope, we get some this time around. Talking about &#x3C;stron&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; conference, I am sad that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is not happening this year too. I am hoping the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; can be the lucky year for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Please do enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#569 - Fundraising for Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/569.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;4 weeks ago I &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/565.html&#x22;&#x3E;asked you to support the Perl Weekly&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It got very little response. Then 2 weeks ago I wrote &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/567.html&#x22;&#x3E;how disappointed I am&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Wow, the abuse I received for that. Both on Reddit an in private emails.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The funny thing is that the people who got upset that I asked for people to show their support are mostly the ones who never did anything for Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;However, the really imporant thing is that within 24 hours some 20 additional people started to support Mohammad and today we are already at 50 supporters! I was very impressed. Thank you!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Thank you!&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In any case, think about this as a fund-raiser for Perl. For many years I hardly saw any fund-raising effort by TPF. This week, to my great surprise they put out a prospectus calling for support. I hope they have the communication channels to spread the information about it and will do the legwork that is need to get the support of the community.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For some strange reason they still mix Perl and Raku. Frankly I think it would be much better to both Perl and Raku if they stopped this mix and the two names/languages/dialects, whatever you call them, went separate ways.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anyway, if you are interested to financially support the Perl activists, you now have a choice: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/new-prospectus-launched-june-22&#x22;&#x3E;TPF&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, directly &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar/&#x22;&#x3E;Mohammand S. Anwar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, other &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/supporting-perl-creators&#x22;&#x3E;Perl-related creators&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/568.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A big round of applause to the entire team behind the ground breaking release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have been following the features of the latest release very closely. I am confident it would be a solid foundation for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;v7&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have you had chance to play with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If not then please do checkout my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2022/06/do-you-want-to-get-started-with-perl-v536.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, where I shared my first hand experience playing with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have you ever thought of contributing to your favourite language, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A little over a decade, I submitted a small patch via email. Those days, the process was not as smooth as it is today. Unfortunately I never received any acknowledgment. Ever since &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, found the new home in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, it is so easy to submit the patches. I submitted a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19853&#x22;&#x3E;small change&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to the core Perl. To my surprise, in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 days&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, it got accepted and merged. It has given me confidence to submit more.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Why don&#x27;t you also give it a try?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least, I would like to thank each and everyone for all the support &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;via Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I received in the last few weeks. I am overwhelmed, to be honest.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#567 - What is in Perl v5.36</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/567.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two weeks ago I asked you to show your support of the newsletter by supporting &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar/&#x22;&#x3E;Manwar via Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. 2 people added their support. Let me thank the two of you and to all the others who were already supporting him or me!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;However, I also have to say I am utterly disappointed. There are 4,700 subscribers and only 25 who would support Manwar?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is a recurring discussion on why Perl is disappearing. This is part of it. Very few people contribute to the Perl ecosystem.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I get it, not everyone feels up to the task of maintaining a CPAN module or writing an article. Not everyone has the time for these. That&#x27;s fine. In that case giving 5-10 USD a month to someone who does a huge amount of work would be a very easy way to show your support and help the Perl ecosystem.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Or have you already totally given up on Perl?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#566 - v7 &#x26; Corinna</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/566.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally we have yet another feature packed release &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, thanks to the entire team involved.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you want to know all about the latest release? If yes then please refer to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/release/RJBS/perl-5.36.0/view/pod/perldelta.pod&#x22;&#x3E;official page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for more informations.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The very first question comes to our mind after the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; release is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;What happened to v7?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The Perl Steering Council (PSC) came up with the detailed response about everything including &#x3C;strong&#x3E;v7&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/psc/2022/05/what-happened-to-perl-7.html&#x22;&#x3E;official blog&#x3C;/a&#x3E; page.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have been closely following the development of Modern OO in core Perl i.e. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am now looking forward to the next release i.e. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, which is likely to introduce &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. So the next question, how long is the wait? I am told, we can expect it in about a year time from now. To be honest, I am happy to wait.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Together with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;v7&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I am confident it would bring fresh air and positive energy among the community. I would urge everyone, please don&#x27;t loose hope and stay strong together.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am running daily &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; feature post sharing the bits that I didn&#x27;t know before or never used before. It goes back to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.10&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It has brought back &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to the discussion table. I have learnt a lot of edge cases about each feature by many experts on various social platforms e.g. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Facebook Groups&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; like &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Community&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Programmers&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you are active on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Twitter&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then you can follow the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; feature post on my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/cpan_author&#x22;&#x3E;personal twitter handle&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you are interested in the past feature post then you can take a look at my dedicated &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you have suggestions to improve then please feel free to submit pull request.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We are having week off from school duty as it is school holiday time. Double that up with Queen&#x27;s Jubilee celebration, wow. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#565 - Supporting the Perl Weekly</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/565.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two weeks ago I wrote about the issues we are facing with the Perl Weekly. I got a lot of responses and then yesterday I also noticed there were quite few comments on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/unb6yd/do_you_want_the_perl_weekly_to_continue/&#x22;&#x3E;Reddit&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as well. Let me thank all the responses now.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Many people suggested that we could switch to sending out every 2 weeks or once a month, but I don&#x27;t think either of those would be a good idea. Some people suggested we (Mohammad and myself) should write more articles or interview people. Well, no. The Perl Weekly is specifically about collecting &#x3C;b&#x3E;your&#x3C;/b&#x3E; content and sharing it. So it is the wider Perl community that could solve the content-problem by writing more articles. Which brings me to one of our posts today. Dave Cross had another nice idea, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/davorg/cpan-module-tutorials-2be9&#x22;&#x3E;linking to tutorials of CPAN modules from MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. You don&#x27;t need to write some article on a topic that has never been mentioned. It would be enough to take one of the modules you use anyway. Put together an example on how to use it. Add some explanations and then post it on your blog. (Which could be very simple using GitHub pages.) Send us the link and also include it in the CSV file of Dave.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some people suggested to have a (better) web version and RSS feed. You are welcome to send a PR changing the web version to be better. The source of the Perl Weekly is &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. We also have two different RSS feeds: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/perlweekly.rss&#x22;&#x3E;latest edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/index.rss&#x22;&#x3E;10 most recent editions&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. However these get updated only once a week. If you really like RSS, you might want to use the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.theplanetarium.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Planetarium&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by who else, Dave Cross.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There was some back-and-forth on Reddit whether the Perl-related Facebook groups are the best thing on earth or the worst thing on Earth. I think both sides are right. On one hand Facebook is a black hole that anything going there is invisible from the outside world - that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t often link to it. On the other hand the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Community&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlprogrammers/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl programmers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Facebook groups seem to be the most active locations for discussing anything about Perl. So let&#x27;s thank those Perl Mongers who spend time in these groups helping the newcomers. If I may suggest something, if you are not doing it yet: You could also try to direct them to the Perl Weekly and you could also work with them to set up a public blog (or use &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/t/perl&#x22;&#x3E;dev.to&#x3C;/a&#x3E;) and write a post about something Perl related.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally, some people suggested to ask for a grant from The Perl Foundation. Here is the thing. Money in itself is not an issue, but feeling that the work we do is appreciated goes a long way. The many responses I got show that there are at least a few people who value our work. Thank you!. However, if the issue of money was already raised you could use some money to show your appreciation. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;Mohammad S Anwar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; has Patreon account with currently 23 supporters. Can we double this number? I also have a Patreon account, but for me a much better boost would be if you checked out the web-site of my son and became a user and a paying subscriber. It is called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://torto.ai/welcome?utm_source=perlweekly&#x26;utm_medium=email&#x26;utm_campaign=perlweekly565&#x22;&#x3E;torto.ai&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. That will make me a lot happier than any money you might send to my Patreon account.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So that&#x27;s about it for now.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#564 - Issues with OOP?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/564.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am a big fan OOP and can&#x27;t wait to see Modern Object in Perl, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, to be part of core Perl. Last update I had was in early January by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. You can checkout the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2022/01/msg262335.html&#x22;&#x3E;details here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you are new to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then I would recommend you checkout &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki/Porting-from-Moose-or-Moo&#x22;&#x3E;this post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Those who don&#x27;t know, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is leading the team working on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Talking about OOP, I came across another &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://ovid.github.io/articles/common-problems-in-object-oriented-code.html&#x22;&#x3E;post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by none other than &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; himself sharing the common issues with OO code. This should be taught to anyone starting OO in any language and not just Perl, in my humble opinion. Having read it few times already from start to end in one go, I keep going back to it to keep myself reminded about it all the time. You would definitely want to bookmark it for future reference.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Few weeks ago, I shared post &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://ovid.github.io/articles/why-is-object-oriented-programming-bad.html&#x22;&#x3E;Why is Object-Oriented Programming Bad?&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by Curtis. My favourite line in the post, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;I think there&#x2019;s a good case to be made that OOP is not nearly as useful as it&#x2019;s claimed.&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Mind you, this is coming from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enough of OO, lets talk about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Exceptions in Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I would like to share the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://gist.github.com/Ovid/5205534f7dcc52e4d931aaff301b39aa&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; (once again), where he points out the common issue in Perl. It reminded me about my recent &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v534/try-catch.pl&#x22;&#x3E;post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; sharing the new try/catch block in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.34&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not the least, please find this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://gist.github.com/Ovid/0ef90f9f48f04fdad5d2ee8204fab776&#x22;&#x3E;gem&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; talking about testing database operations with a fresh instance of SQLite everytime. I wonder, if this can be shared as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN module&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Just thinking out loud, I know.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#563 - Shall we continue the newsletter?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/563.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two weeks ago I switched the email sending from an old mailman installation on my own server to Sendgrid. I was hoping to fix the delivery issues, but that did not happen. Some subscribers who have not received the newsletter earlier started to receive it, others stopped receiving it. The big difference is that now I see a report of who has not received it. For example I see many @cpan.org addresses in the bounce list. That&#x27;s just sad. I got some offers to use other services, free of charge, but frankly I am quite tired of fighting the SPAM filters.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In other news, we really hardly have any items to include in the newsletter. Well, except of the responsed to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, the job posts, and the posts of Flavio Poletti.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;These two issues together, and I really started to wonder if we should continue publishing the newsletter. What do you think?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
