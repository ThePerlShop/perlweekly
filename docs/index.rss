<title>#645 - Advent Calendars</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/645.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Welcome to the new subscribers!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;December has arrived and with it the season of the Advent Calendars. You might recall that Len Jaffe has an Advent Calendar aggregator called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Planet&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you know a running calendar that is not listed there, please contact Len!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It lists the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://raku-advent.blog/2023/&#x22;&#x3E;Raku advent calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and a few more. Ingy dot Net pointed to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://yamlscript.org/posts/advent-2023/index/&#x22;&#x3E;YAML Script Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the previous edition Mohammad sent a call to get sponsor for his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Weekly programming challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Several people replied to me. Those messages were forwarded to Mohammad as that is his gig. However, I noticed that the link we used to have at the top of the Perl Weekly was only showing up on the web site. I added it back. In a nutshell, if you&#x27;d like to spoonsor/financially help the work of Mohammad S Anwar then either contact him or just support him via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you&#x27;d like to support my work then you can do so either via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or vi &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#644 - Perl Sponsor?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/644.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you or your company sponsor Perl directly or indirectly?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As we all know, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perlfoundation.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Foundation&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, is the parent organisation responsible for the development of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; programming languages. They are also the single point of contact for any donations, whether individual or corporate. Without a doubt they are doing great service promoting &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; programming languages. I have personally seen how they support annual conferences around the globe.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Why am I talking about it today?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I run &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; project primarily focus on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; but open to all programming languages. It was started on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;25th March 2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It has been going on un-interrupted ever since, thanks to the strong &#x3C;strong&#x3E;350+&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; members of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We were lucky enough to have solo sponsor, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.careers&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Careers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; run by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Peter Sergeant&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; since &#x3C;strong&#x3E;July 2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; without break. Initially we had weekly prize sponsorship but later it was changed to monthly sponsorship. The best part was, I didn&#x27;t have to move a finger to find the sponsor. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Pete&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was generous enough to come forward and continued supporting the project for such a long time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Is it time to look for new sponsor?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, we are not expensive to sponsor, honestly speaking. The prize money has been &#x3C;strong&#x3E;50 USD&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; since the beginning. Although I have been looking for new sponsors for sometime but never done anything about it. It is just not my cup of tea. Because of this, I put the code move on hold for such a long time. Ideally I wanted to move the code base to pure &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; solution instead of currently &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hugo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; which is based on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Go&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I also wanted to move away from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub pages&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; hosted solution to a proper hosted solution that we can manage ourself. I could have requested &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for financial help but again I am not competent enough to make formal request. As we are growing very fast every week, it is getting out of hand to manage the contributions by the team member. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; takes lot longer to process the data as some of the team member complained about it too. I wish we had our own repository to manage the contributions.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Any help or suggestions are most welcome.&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not the least, please do remember all those affected by the recent conflicts in your daily prayer. Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#643 - My birthday wishes</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/643.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yesterday was my birthday. Usually we go out for a dinner with my family, but this time it did not feel appropriate, we are not really in the mood of celebrations. Then I realized this year I&#x27;d like you, dear readers, to do me a favor, read my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/birthday-2023&#x22;&#x3E;birthday wishes&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and help make them come true! Please, don&#x27;t send a mail with Happy Birthday in it unless you read my wished and can also comment on them. Thank you!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I mentioned earlier that I struggle finding Perl-related content to include. Last week I looked more thoroughly at the content of what Mohammad sent and I had to realize that the vast majority of the posts are in the &#x3C;b&#x3E;Weekly challenge&#x3C;/b&#x3E; section. There are hardly any other posts. So I was happy to receive a request from Roy Schestowitz to mention the article about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://news.tuxmachines.org/n/2023/11/11/A_Perl_Based_Static_Site_and_Gemini_Capsule_Generator_The_Story.shtml&#x22;&#x3E;A Perl-Based Static Site and Gemini Capsule Generator: The Story of tuxmachines.org and techrights.org&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In other news I am really glad by all the people who subscribed to my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rust.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;newsletter about Rust&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Is is growing at a nice pace. My other newsletter &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;about Israel&#x3C;/a&#x3E; also got quite a few new subscribers. Even the one &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://izrael.szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;in Hungarian about Israel&#x3C;/a&#x3E; grew. If you are interested in either of these topics and would like to know what I think about them, then subscribe now!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you would like to stick to Perl, then I&#x27;d like to recommend checking out the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2023/11/closing-on-112323-thursday---2024-tprc-science-track-survey.html&#x22;&#x3E;2024 TPRC Science Track Survey&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the calls to volunteer at &#x3C;b&#x3E;FOSDEM&#x3C;/b&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#642 - Perl and PAUSE</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/642.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Have you uploaded a module to CPAN?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If yes then you will have come across &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PAUSE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. One of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PAUSE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; admins, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, has written handful of blog posts to help anyone understand the internals. I would recommend you start with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://neilb.org/2014/03/11/uploading-01.html&#x22;&#x3E;What happens when you upload to CPAN?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I have seen beginners fighting with issues related to versioning. You should checkout one more cool post: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://neilb.org/2013/07/16/version-numbers.html&#x22;&#x3E;Semantic Version&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you want more?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; If yes there here is one more post on the same subject by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2016/12/version-numbers&#x22;&#x3E;Version Numbers&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;During the research, I found an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/neil-bowers&#x22;&#x3E;interview&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; with the chief editor &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I really enjoyed watching it after a long time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How do you debug your Perl script?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I belong to old school and still today use the command line switch &#x3C;strong&#x3E;-d&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for debugging. I know there are other ways of debugging. Recently I tried using editor &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Visual Studio Code&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; with the help of colleague at work. Although I liked the visual debugging but for me &#x3C;strong&#x3E;old is gold&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are new to debugging then you should checkout the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtAGbUYTnR0&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube video&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ricardo Signes&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ever thought of contributing to Perl?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In old days (15 years for me), it was really complicated subject. Ever since the move to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, it is lot easier to contribute now. The official &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org/perlhack&#x22;&#x3E;guide&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is out there if you fancy. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; written a detailed post: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/2021/02/writing-perl-core-feature.html&#x22;&#x3E;Writing a Perl Core Feature&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am sure you have enough to keep you busy until next week. Last but not least belated Happy Diwali everyone.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#641 - Advent Calendars</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/641.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am sitting in my bomb-shelter trying to think what could I write about Perl, but frankly nothing comes to my mind. There is hardly anything going on in the Perl world. I barely managed to find 7 articles to include.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As you might know &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://lenjaffe.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Len Jaffe&#x3C;/a&#x3E; runs the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Planet&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, an aggregation of Advent calendars. He asked us to mention that if you are planning to run an advent calendar, contact him to be included in his aggregator!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So what can I write about? In the last 2 weeks I managed to work a bit and for one week I volunteered to work on a farm to pick avocados. At least during that time I did not watch news and did not have to hear about the total loss of sanity on the streets of the Western cities and in many of the Western university campuses.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So what am I working on? I have been working a lot on my Rust projects. If you are interested to follow what I am doing here are the instructions to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rust.code-maven.com/subscribe&#x22;&#x3E;subscribe&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to my newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you are interested in my point of view about what&#x27;s going on in Israel and what&#x27;s going on in the world about &#x27;the conflict&#x27;, I have another newsletter with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/subscribe&#x22;&#x3E;instructions to subscribe&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally a reminder: if you&#x27;d like to see more Perl-related content in the Perl Weekly, then write more!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#640 - Perl Workshop</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/640.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I noticed recently the videos of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDtghjWTaH3CMKDYXcMhCMCNDekVq9iK&#x22;&#x3E;25th German Perl Workshop&#x3C;/a&#x3E; made public. It reminded me sweet and pleasant memory when I first attended the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;20th German Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It was my first ever &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; outside of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I still don&#x27;t know why I decided to attend it, knowing &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is going to be the main language. The best part of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GPW 2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was that I never felt outsider during the 3 days event. Infact, at one point, I was attending a talk in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, a friend of mine, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, sitting next to me translating the talk realtime for me. I even received a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; book in &#x3C;stron&#x3E;German&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; after team dinner one evening. I made many new friends during the event. I even shared the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2018/04/20th-german-perl-workshop---report.html&#x22;&#x3E;event report&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I still go back read it when I feel low.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Why am I talking about it now?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the last edition, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; mentioned &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/639.html&#x22;&#x3E;Standards of Conduct&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.I was planning to attend &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlconference.us/tprc-2022-hou/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2022&#x3C;/a&#x3E; but then dropped the idea as it was held in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Houston, TX&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There was nothing wrong with the location as such. I felt little uncomfortable visiting &#x3C;strong&#x3E;USA&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; being a practising muslim. I decided to wait until it goes to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Canada&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. My wish came true the following year as the venue was &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I finally got the opportunity to attend it at last. I had a great time and met many big names. Having attended the conference in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, now I feel confident to attend the next conference in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las/&#x22;&#x3E;Las Vegas&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If everything goes as per plan then I would even take my family as well.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How about London Perl Workshop?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Being member of organising committee of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I know it is not happing this year. I really miss it badly. I hope and pray it is back next year. It is not that we never talk about it. We do discuss but nothing has materialised so far. Traditionally, it is one day event, so it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to get decent crowd. The last time we organised was in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2019/&#x22;&#x3E;year 2019&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. There was a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2022/09/london-perl-workshop-status-update-2023.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; last year with regard to the status of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How about Perl Advent Calendar this year?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am so happy to see the preparation for this year is going with full speed. I missed the train last year because of lack of time. But this year, I have booked a slot for myself. If you are interested to contribute then please do &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent&#x22;&#x3E;checkout&#x3C;/a&#x3E; the source. Talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, there is a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Planet&#x3C;/a&#x3E; run by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Len Jaffe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you run &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then do share the details with him. I did share &#x3C;a hrf=&#x22;https://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/2021/index.html&#x22;&#x3E;Weekly Challenge Advent Calendar 2021&#x3C;/a&#x3E; but looks like I forgot to share &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2022/&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Calendar 2022&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with him.

<title>#639 - Standards of Conduct</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/639.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A couple of month ago, Mohammad, my co-editor, expressed his anxiety about travelling to TPRC while being called Mohammad. As I understood he was afraid of authorities: the security checks and the border control. He was not afraid of the conference itself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not afraid of the authorities, but in the last couple of days I was wondering if I&#x27;d feel safe going to a Perl conference, so I checked the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las/index.php/standards-of-conduct/&#x22;&#x3E;Standards of Conduct&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of The Perl and Raku Foundation. It says:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x22;...we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, or country of origin.&#x22;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On one hand I think it is totally unnecessary to have this list, the environment should be welcoming to every person. On the other hand, if the list was already provided, then the omissions also have meaning.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am glad it mentions &#x27;country of origin&#x27;, but it does not mention &#x27;country of residence&#x27;. So will I, someone who was born in Hungary, but lives in Israel, will I be protected at such conference? Or will it be OK, as it happened in the past, that people came to me and harassed me because I live in Israel?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the last two weeks many of my friends asked me how am I and how is my family. It made me start a new blog first &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://izrael.szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;in Hungarian&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and yesterday I started &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;an English version&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you are interested in &#x3C;b&#x3E;my view&#x3C;/b&#x3E; then you are welcome to read those posts and subscribe to the newsletters to be notified when I publish a articles.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Earlier some people suggested I create a separate newsletter for my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rust.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Rust-releated content&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. At first I was not sure about that, but I think they are right. So here it is. You are invited to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://groups.google.com/g/rust-maven&#x22;&#x3E;subscribe to Rust Maven&#x3C;/a&#x3E;!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a nice week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#638 - Dancing Perl?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/638.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What a great and pleasant surprise announcement of the release of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/jason_a_crome/2023/10/announcing-dancer2-100.html&#x22;&#x3E;Dancer2 1.0.0&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dancer Core Team&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; !!!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am a big fan of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dancer2&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, so I follow closely the development of my favourite web framework. If you remember there was another announcement recently about change in the core team as &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/jason_a_crome/2023/09/announcing-dancer-core-team-changes.html&#x22;&#x3E;Ruth Holloway&#x3C;/a&#x3E; joining the core team. I am very happy that it is in safe hand and actively developed/maintained by the core team.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hacktoberfest 2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is still going on. Have you done the minimum pull request required to complete the challenge? If not then you still have time to do. Please make sure you submit your pull request before the deadline i.e. last day of the month. In the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I managed to submit &#x3C;strong&#x3E;160 pull requests&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in one month. Unfortunately for the last couple of years, I haven&#x27;t participated in the event because of other commitments.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you want to play with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;AI&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;? Luckily we have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://chatgpu.ai/pages/navi-ai&#x22;&#x3E;Navi AI&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I strongly recommend, you give it a go.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not the least, let us all pray for the peace in both sides of the conflicts. I don&#x27;t watch news these days as they are full of heart breaking news.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#637 - We are in shock</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/637.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some people compare the terrorist attacks in the south of Israel to 9/11, and compare the number of killed relative to the size of the country.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;However, I think there are some other, more shocking aspects of what happened, and to some extent is still happening here.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The Palestinian terrorists, whom are called &#x27;freedom fighters&#x27; by their supporters in the West, went from house to house, looked in the eyes of their victims and executed them. They looked in the eyes and murdered men, women, the elderly, and even children.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;They kidnapped 150 people, including an 85 years old women, several 5-8 years old children and even a 6 month old baby.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Israel is a small country (9.5 million people) with a lot of interconnected families. Each one of us either has a relative or personally knows someone who has a relative among the dead, kidnapped, or wounded. This is personal to us. This is personal to me.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am sure many of you are just as shaken as we are and some of you also ask what can you do?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I think you can follow some of the people who share information and share it with more people. For example &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/in/yoseph-haddad-a97a47198/&#x22;&#x3E;Yoseph Haddad&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and Israeli Arab who has been a clear voice for quite some time. (He also has Facebook and Instagram pages).&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As I am collecting the Perl-related articles and while I am writing this I hear the explosions as the Iron Dome takes down the rockets fired by the Palestinians to kill citizens in Tel Aviv. It is surreal. Unfortunately, this will be a bloody war with tens of thousands of casualties, but we will restore our security.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We don&#x27;t have any other choice.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#636 - Happy Birthday Larry</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/636.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A belated, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Happy Birthday&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to the creator of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. May the joy that you have spread in the past come back to you on this day. Just for record, the birthday was on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;27th September&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you use &#x3C;strong&#x3E;homebrew&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; did all the hard work to get &#x3C;strong&#x3E;homebrew&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; up to the latest &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are keen to know the details then please do &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/145939&#x22;&#x3E;checkout the pull request&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; recently shared his cool creation, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/oalders/is&#x22;&#x3E;is: an inspector for your environment&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am sure for all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;System Administrators&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; out there, it would be very handy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not sure, if you noticed this but &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmonks.org/&#x22;&#x3E;PerlMonks&#x3C;/a&#x3E; certificate expired few days ago. I only noticed as one of the contributor to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; shared link to the site. The very next day, I saw post by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; on Twitter talking about it and sharing the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.prettygoodping.com&#x22;&#x3E;tool&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that can help avoid such incident in future. The certificate has now been restored.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you know the current maintainer of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN Testers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; server?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I saw &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/groups/perlcommunity/permalink/1538251906982430&#x22;&#x3E;Facebook post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mark Keating&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; just few days ago. I remember, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Doug Bell&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; helped many years ago when I was playing daily &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; upload games. He gave me access to deal with the issues I was facing at the time. I just hope, it stays live and kicking. It is the second best thing for us after &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are interested to sponsor the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then you now have plenty of different options. Please find out more about it in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://opencollective.com/metacpan-core&#x22;&#x3E;official announcement&#x3C;/a&#x3E; page.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
