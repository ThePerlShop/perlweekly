<title>#621 - OSDC - Open Source Development Club</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/621.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Mohammad even though he kept handling &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, skipped the previous edition of the Perl Weekly because he was attending his father who was in a very bad health condition. A couple of days ago he posted on Facebook that his father passed away. Mohammad, let me send you my condolences here, through the Perl Weekly as well!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;OSDC: As you might know I have been using this acronym for a while to stand for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://osdc.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Open Source Development Course&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but I have already seen it used where the C stood for Conference (I even organized one of those), and where the C stood for Club. The goal in all of these cases is to Contribute to open source. (another potential for the letter C).&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I recently joined a club, well, it is basically a Discord server, where Israeli developers help each other get involved in open source. The basic idea is very similar to what I have been talking about for years now: One of the ways for newbies (or juniors) to gain experience and increase their chances to find a job is to work on open source projects. I am really glad that someone created it. There are already more than 600 members. In this group the main conversation language is Hebrew so if you can read and write in Hebrew and if you are interested to join let me know and I&#x27;ll send you the invite link.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I would be also very interested to know if there are other, similar local groups using their own local language elsewhere and if you are familiar with other such clubs that are maybe focused on a specific programming language or maybe a specific project? Links are welcome to my email address!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#620 - Abandoned modules?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/620.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Mohammad asked me to the edition this week as well, so now you are stuck with me. Again :)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week I wrote about my offer to companies to help with the maintenance of open source Perl (and Python) libraries they rely on. One of the responses I got was from someone who wanted to help with abandoned modules in his free time. He asked me which modules are abandoned?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://pause.perl.org/pause/query?ACTION=pause_operating_model&#x22;&#x3E;PAUSE operating model&#x3C;/a&#x3E; mentions 3 special owners that can help identify modules that are up for adoption or otherwise need help. You can see the lists here: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/ByMaintainer.html?Name=ADOPTME&#x22;&#x3E;ADOPTME&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/ByMaintainer.html?Name=HANDOFF&#x22;&#x3E;HANDOFF&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rt.cpan.org/Dist/ByMaintainer.html?Name=NEEDHELP&#x22;&#x3E;NEEDHELP&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;More details can be seen on the CPANMeta site: for example for the modules owned by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpanmeta.grinnz.com/perms?author=ADOPTME&#x26;module=&#x26;match_mode=exact&#x22;&#x3E;ADOPTME&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Another type of listing can be found on Meta::CPAN. e.g. the permissions of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/author/HANDOFF/permissions&#x22;&#x3E;HANDOFF&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally, I&#x27;ve also started to create similar listings with a different view on modules that are up for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/adoption&#x22;&#x3E;adoption&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So if you have free time and would be interested to contribute to the Perl community, one way would be to pick up a module and start maintaining it. If you need help with that, let me know and I&#x27;ll try to point you to the channels where you can get &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/help&#x22;&#x3E;help&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;-&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On a more personal note, I just finished watching the mini-series &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Small_Light&#x22;&#x3E;A Small Light&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It made me really sad and at the same time furious with all the self-declared &#x27;humanitarians&#x27; who try to paint Israel as being similar to Nazi Germany. It is especially disgusting, and even frightening, when celebrities do it and tens of thousands of people celebrate them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;-&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anyway, enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#619 - Maintenance of CPAN modules</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/619.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There are way too many CPAN modules that are abandoned or at least not maintained. Even many central ones rarely see activity. It is not very surprising though. Many people who used to develop and maintain these modules have moved to some job where the particular module is not needed or even where they use other languages. Actually I see similar things in Python as well, but let&#x27;s focus on Perl now.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Encountering an issue in such a module that is hardly maintained is a frustrating experience as you could also read in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2023/05/mission-almost-accomplished/&#x22;&#x3E;recent article&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of Dave Cross. However, it is not only frustrating. It hinders the efforts to get the job done. If it is an individual who wants to write some personal code that&#x27;s &#x27;just&#x27; frustrating. If it is a corporation then this actually cost a lot of money in wasted time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So what can be done about this?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For individuals such as Dave and plenty of people on this list, I think really the only solution is to take over the maintenance of the modules.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A corporation has various strategies. They can allocate time to their employees to fix the issues in the open source libraries. They can hire someone to work on these open source libraries. They could try to contract the developers and maintainers of these modules. Or they can just disregard the problem and basically make their own employees (that&#x27;s probably you) frustrated and waste a lot of time overcoming the issues.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;After I read &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://words.filippo.io/full-time-maintainer/&#x22;&#x3E;this article&#x3C;/a&#x3E; a few weeks ago I wanted to see if I could offer a similar serveice. An alternative to the solutions mentioned before. &#x3C;b&#x3E;In a nutshell&#x3C;/b&#x3E;: companies could contract me specifically to work on the open source libraries they care about. (primarily Perl and Python libraries). I contacted a few companies and started to work with some of them on the idea.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;My original thought was that we&#x27;ll agree upon a certain list of modules and I&#x27;ll work on that. Instead of that my first task is a more generic one. To make a tool that can help us evaluate the problems for a particular set of modules and decide what is more urgent. Basically triage the issues across a few 10s or more likely a few 100s of CPAN modules.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So in the last week or so I changed the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; a lot. Besides listing the most recently uploaded modules it now has a list of the most heavily dependent on modules based on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://neilb.org/2015/04/20/river-of-cpan.html&#x22;&#x3E;river analogy&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of Neil Bowers. It has a page for every distribution and every author. There is plenty of more to improve on it, but I am glad there are at least a few people who see this type of work valuable.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not good at marketing and sales so I figured the only way this model could work if some of you working at corporations who understand the need will become the local champions of the idea. Then we could work together to formulate the service to your management in a way that will be valuable to them. If you think this could help you, talk to me so we can figure this out together.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#618 - Conference Season?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/618.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It seems we have been spoiled with the in-person conference. For all the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans, we got two choices, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.to/tprc-2023-tor&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in Toronto&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlkohacon.fi&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Koha Conference in Helsinki&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I would highly recommend the one convenient to you. We all need to come together and share the knowledge.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am all set for the one in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Thanks to the organisers, I got the time slot to give a talk on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Looking at the list of attendees and speakers, it is going to be fun 3 days event. Looking forward to meet fellow &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; members at the event.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Few weeks ago, I spoke about the ambitious project, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl Conference in India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Soon I realised, it isn&#x27;t the right time to talk about. Although not my idea originally, I am taking a back seat for now. I hope to see it happening in my life time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#617 - The business risks of using CPAN</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/617.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;You might know that I talk and write a lot about Open Source and I have a number of open source projects. Mostly web applications. One of them is the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; where I try to analyze CPAN packages and point to directions for relatively easy improvement. The most basic one would be a link to the public VCS (Version Control System) of the project.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We have some historical data points with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html&#x22;&#x3E;weekly reports&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Around 80% of the recently uploaded distributions have a link to their VCS. It is not bad, but is still 20% less than would be ideal. I am less happy about the fact that only 50% use any CI to check their code before it is released to CPAN.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;All this boils down to trying figure out the business risks of using Open Source 3rd party libraries in general and Perl modules in particular along with ways to alleviate them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;When you or your boss think about your Perl-based application, what are the things that make you worry? Do you bump into issues with modules that are not fixed? If you try to fix the issues, do you feel that it is hard to understand the code of the module?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What would make your life as a programmer using Perl easier? What would make your manager happier? Write a blog post. Comment on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/perlweekly/issues/506&#x22;&#x3E;this issue&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or reply to me in private!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#616 - Camel in India</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/616.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;When I say &#x3C;strong&#x3E;India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I mean &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Indian Subcontinent&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; i.e. Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Srilanka. Having said, my prime concern is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; right now. You must have realised the context of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Camel&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by now. Today I would like to talk about the popularity of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I remember when I left &#x3C;strong&#x3E;India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2000&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, it was on the rise and that is how I got into &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Programming&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. After moving to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;England&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I noticed how frequent the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans meetup and share ideas. I got the opportunity to attend some and realised how it can boost the popularity of the language and spread the positive word among newbies. Regular &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Mongers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; meet also keep the subject live and active.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Ever since the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;COVID&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; happened, all these in-person events stopped initially. But the good news is that we are getting back on track with the events like &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.to/tprc-2023-tor&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2023&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlkohacon.fi&#x22;&#x3E;Perl and Koha Conference in Helsinki&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I have decided to attend &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in Canada&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have submitted talk proposal too, little late though. I am still waiting for the acceptance. The other conference is clashing with my planned visit to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; unfortunately.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Going back to the main topic, I am wondering if we ever had any &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Conference in India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am aware of active &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Mongers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; but never heard of their activities. In the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2021&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Will Braswell&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; reached out to me with a proposal to do &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl Conference in India&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Because of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;COVID&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, we put it on hold then. At the time, we decided to do month long tour to cover major cities spending 2-3 days in each city. I suggested the best time would be &#x3C;strong&#x3E;August&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as I will have long summer break. We would definitely need sponsors, ideally if we do under the banner of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl Foundation&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then the reach would be even greater, in my humble opinion. The local &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Mongers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; group can be handy in organising the event. I would be eager to know if any &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Mongers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; group interested in these events. I would expect the groups down south would be more active as they are highly aware of technologies in general.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I just realised this is my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;130th edition&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of the weekly newsletter. I also completed &#x3C;strong&#x3E;5 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as co-editor of the weekly newsletter in this month.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter. Please do share your ideas and suggestions.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#615 - PTS - Perl Toolchain Summit</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/615.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perltoolchainsummit.org/pts2023/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was held last week in Lyon, France. The website itself does not have a lot of information on it, but luckily the participants have blogged about it. There is plenty for you to read now if you&#x27;d like to keep up with the development in Perl, how to package Perl modules; how to install them, how CPAN and MetaCPAN work etc.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The PTS is a small even for people who are very deeply involved in the Perl ecosystem. It is a brain-storming session and a Hackathon. I wish there were similar session held more frequently around the world.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you are looking for some Perl related event to participate in, there are two that I know of listed at the bottom of the newsletter and on our &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events.html&#x22;&#x3E;events page&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. One is the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc2023.sched.com/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in July in Toronto, Canada&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the other one is the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlkohacon.fi/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl and Koha conference&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in August in Helsinki, Finland.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you have the time and the budget make sure you attend at least one of them!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the meantime, enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#614 - Why not Perl?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/614.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Few days ago, I found this article, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://two-wrongs.com/why-perl&#x22;&#x3E;Why Perl?&#x3C;/a&#x3E; shared on Facebook. To be honest, there was nothing new in the article, same old bits discussed. Depending on who you ask the question, the chance you might get crispy answer. Well here we have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY/2023/04/29/why-perl&#x22;&#x3E;one&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Flavio Poletti&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In my career of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;over 25&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; years, I have been part of team building robust application using &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the nearly every domain under the sun. At my current work place, I got the opportunity to work on a really huge system mostly built using &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Having said, I do agree that not many people talk about the power of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We should all take the collective responsibility and make sure we don&#x27;t miss a single opportunity to promote &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Did you know that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Toolchain Summit 2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is back?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Altough I am not as active on social platforms as before, I hardly seen any news about it. I just happen to see some activities on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by a friend of mine and realised the big event is back after a gap of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;4 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. One of the participant, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Johnson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; already shared the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/paul_johnson/2023/04/the-perl-toolchain-summit-2023.html&#x22;&#x3E;event report&#x3C;/a&#x3E; if you are interested. I am hoping few more in coming days by other participants.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is rarely discussed in the field of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Artificial Intelligence (AI)&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, right?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Now we have a project, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PerlGPT&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; supported by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/perlgpt&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl Foundation&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. We should all promote the project and help in any possible ways.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Similarly there was another big news about latest release of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1344vs5/pdl_2083_released_and_updates_from_a_year_of&#x22;&#x3E;PDL 2.083&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least, in few weeks time we are going to have a much awaiting release of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/blob/275f4e511457b9578602fc7a19a23cde36fe66bb/Porting/release_schedule.pod?plain=1#L54&#x22;&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am confident it would silence the negative voices. Till then enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#613 - CPAN Dashboard</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/613.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; one of the links I display is the link to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpandashboard.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Dashboard&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of each author. Assuming they have configured it. Every time I look at the CPAN Digger I feel surprised that so few of the CPAN authors have set up the Dashboard. Even among the active ones.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you are a CPAN author, tell me, is it because you don&#x27;t know about the dashboard, you don&#x27;t know how to set it up, or that it does not provide you enough value? The first we solved now. For the second, there is a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpandashboard.com/add/&#x22;&#x3E;page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; explaining it. In case you don&#x27;t feel its value, let me know what would be interesting to you in such a dashboard?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On Wednesday we are celebrating the 75th &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_Day_(Israel)&#x22;&#x3E;Independence Day of Israel&#x3C;/a&#x3E; which is preceded by two memorial days. As someone eloquently put it: Jews have two memorial days &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaZikaron&#x22;&#x3E;Yom HaZikaron&#x3C;/a&#x3E; (Memorial Day for the Fallen Soldiers of the Wars of Israel and Victims of Actions of Terrorism) to remind us of the cost of having Israel and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah&#x22;&#x3E;Yom HaShhoah&#x3C;/a&#x3E; (Holocaust Memorial Day) to remind us the cost of not. The memorial days are hard, but the Independence day is a huge event celebrating having our own country again after 2000 years of not having it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your Week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#612 - Coming Soon!</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/612.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;So what&#x27;s coming soon!&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well it&#x27;s the subject of the talk to be presented by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; at &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc2023.sched.com/event/1Lhr0/coming-soon&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2023, TORONTO, Canada.&#x3C;/a&#x3E; I have been waiting for the event to come to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Canada&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as going to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;America&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was never on card. Post &#x3C;strong&#x3E;9/11&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, travelling to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;America&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; having &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mohammad&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as first name isn&#x27;t good idea. Having seen the list of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc2023.sched.com/directory/speakers&#x22;&#x3E;speakers&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I am sure it&#x27;s going to be lots of fun. I really wanted to attend the event and meet the top guns. So what&#x27;s stopping me? I haven&#x27;t been keeping well in the recent months. I know my current employer, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.oleeo.com&#x22;&#x3E;Oleeo&#x3C;/a&#x3E; has been regular sponsor of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and have sponsored selected few to attend various events in the past. Having said, I have to be mentally prepared before I take the plunge but I really don&#x27;t want to miss the opportunity. I still remember the first time, I attended the talk by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was at &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German Perl Workshop 2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and it was about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c8ixLgpxwo&#x22;&#x3E;Rescuing Legacy Code&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. After that I met him again at &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl Conference 2019, Riga&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I think that was the last time I ever attended any conference in person. I am not sure if I still have time to reserve a place or even submit a short talk proposal at &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Talking about conference, I would also like to mention another big event in Europe, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlkohacon.fi&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Koha Conference in Helsinki&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. They have extended time to accept talks. So if you are planning to attend then please do submit your proposal now. I am planning to visit India in the month of August otherwise I would have given a push.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am a big fan of writing skills of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Damian Conway&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and many more. It&#x27;s not just about blog post but also about their books. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; recently published &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://actions.davecross.co.uk/&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub Actions Essentials&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I haven&#x27;t read it yet but I am confident it is going to be worth spending time and money.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter and please do take extra care of your health.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
