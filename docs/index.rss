<title>#705 - Something is moving</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/705.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It seems something is moving in the Perl world. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/new-community-engagement-chair&#x22;&#x3E;D Ruth Holloway became the Community Engagement Chair&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, Dave Cross started to build a web site for the Proposed Perl Changes, and there are going to be changes.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the other hand one of the long-time Perl enthusiasts sent me an angry unsubscribe email telling me how some people (this time it was not me) are ruining Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Fun times!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;At the bottom of the newsletter and also on our &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;Perl events page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; you can find out about all the Perl-related events we know about. If yours isn&#x27;t listed there, it is just a Pull-Request to add it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#704 - Perl Podcast</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/704.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you know of any active Perl Podcast?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It reminds me when &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance Wicks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; reached out to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Joshua McAdams&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to revive &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://www.perlcast.com&#x22;&#x3E;Perlcast&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I later joined hands with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and we even recorded the first podcast with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t work out. Fast forward, in the new year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, we have another very active member, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Philippe Bruhat&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, who came up with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://underbar.cpan.io&#x22;&#x3E;The Underbar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Podcast for Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There is already &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Episode 0 - A New Logo for Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is published which was recorded on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;January 10th, 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. You should listen to it and share your feedbacks to the creator. Also please do spread the word about it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German Perl/Raku Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is happening in the beautiful city &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Munich&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Even if &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is not your first language, you can still benefit from the presentations. I attended the workshop in the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, my first time. I enjoyed the 3-days event thoroughly. I even gave couple of presentations in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;English&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. For me, it was the golden opportunity to meet so many &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; stalwarts. I made many friends for life. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/register&#x22;&#x3E;Buy your tickets now&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, it is starting on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;12th May 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and ends on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;14th May 2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is another good news in the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2025&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; has secured sponsor for another 12 months, thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance Wicks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for the second year back to back.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Stay safe and enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#703 - Teach me some Perl!</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/703.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;After the Advent calendars and the vacation days it seems people are still tired and there is not much content to share. So let me repeat and rephrase my call for speaker for the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://live.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;online live events&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;At these online meetings I&#x27;d like to see guests who would teach me, and the audience, interesting stuff. Eg. &#x27;How to write Object oriented code in Perl?&#x27;, &#x27;How to write a web application using Mojolicious?&#x27;,  &#x27;How to process huge amounts of data with Perl?&#x27;, just to give you a few ideas.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There could be presentations on how a particular module works, and how to contribute to that module.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;These could be also about Python, Rust, or some other interesting language, but I guess the readers of this newsletter will more likely know and want to share Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;These could be well-prepared presentations, or they can be more ad-hoc, pair-programming sessions. Just as you&#x27;d explain things to a new co-worker.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;After each presentation we stay around and have a discussion. It is way better than just watching the video, but of course you have to join us at the live event to enjoy that. I hope to see you at one of the events either as listener or as guest speaker!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anyway, if you are interested, check out the  &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://live.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;planned live events&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and send me an email with a topic you&#x27;d like to talk about.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#702 - Perl Camel</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/702.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Let us all welcome the new year with Hope and Positivity.&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As we bid farewell to the past year, we step forward into a new chapter full of fresh opportunities and untapped potential. The dawn of a new year brings with it a promise of new beginnings, a chance to turn the page on challenges faced and to embrace the joys that lie ahead.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As we all know, we just celebrated &#x3C;strong&#x3E;25 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, of all the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;24 gifts&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; we had this year, my favourite ones: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-19.html&#x22;&#x3E;Half My Life with Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-23.html&#x22;&#x3E;A New Logo for Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. As far as the live stream of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Randal Schwartz&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, we were all notified in advance but the surprise entry was the announcement of new &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Camel for Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. As per the tradition, we have a public repository where anyone can share ideas and comments: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/metacpan/perl-assets&#x22;&#x3E;perl-assets&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. There is even a public channel, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://app.slack.com/client/T2VEZKFPG/C05KBHFH1AA&#x22;&#x3E;#perl-logo&#x3C;/a&#x3E; under the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;perlfoundation&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; slack workspace where you can discuss the subject with others. The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.org&#x22;&#x3E;perl.org&#x3C;/a&#x3E; site has already adopted the new logo. It is also used in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org&#x22;&#x3E;Perldoc&#x3C;/a&#x3E; website. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;OpenCage&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; also used the new logo in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://opencagedata.com/tutorials&#x22;&#x3E;tutorials section&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, there is another very popular project: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://adventofcode.com&#x22;&#x3E;Advent of Code&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I came across one very &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blog.aschoch.ch/posts/aoc-2024&#x22;&#x3E;special contribution&#x3C;/a&#x3E; where the contributor used &#x3C;strong&#x3E;25 different programming languages&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; where we had one entry for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blog.aschoch.ch/posts/aoc-2024#19&#x22;&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as well.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For all, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Mongers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fan, we now have a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://londonperl.org&#x22;&#x3E;new home&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for taking the initiative. I hope we resume the regular meetup too.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least, please do take care of your physical and mental health. Enjoy rest of the newsletter,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#701 - Happier New Year!</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/701.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Most of you are probably on vacation and will get back to work at the beginning of January. I hope you&#x27;ll have a better year than 2024 was. We, here in Israel, don&#x27;t usually have vacation days at this time of the year, but this year the 8 days of Hanukkah started on December 25th. This means the schools are closed, the kids are on vacation and some people also take vacations days. We too had two days off.  On Thursday we visited the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://izrael.szabgab.com/hanuka-2024-2&#x22;&#x3E;Dead Sea&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and on Sunday we went to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://izrael.szabgab.com/hanuka-2024-5&#x22;&#x3E;Tel Aviv&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I wrote about our visits in my personal blog in Hungarian. There are some pictures and some auto-translate might also help you with the text. I hope you also do some special things during your vacation time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;You might have seen that a while ago I started to give &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://live.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;live online presentations about Rust, Python, and Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. On that page you can see both the previous presentations and the planned ones. You might notice that in most of the cases the planned events have a guest speaker. That&#x27;s sort of my new year&#x27;s resolution. I decided that starting from January I&#x27;ll invite guest speakers. After all they have a lot more knowledge than I do.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you are interested in these virtual meetings and would like to get notified about them, join the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/&#x22;&#x3E;Code Mavens Meetup group&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that I use for the registration. There is one directly Perl-related &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/304874972/&#x22;&#x3E;GitLab pipelines and CI for Perl developers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; still by myself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The rest of the calendar still has lots of empty spaces for Perl-related presentations. If you are interested to give one, please &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://szabgab.com/contact&#x22;&#x3E;contact me&#x3C;/a&#x3E;! It can be a presentation with slides and all the usual stuff, but it can also be a walk-through of some code-base (e.g. showing how something is implemented in a certain Perl module). It can also be something more pair-programming style where you show me how to do something in Perl. e.g. Show me how to build a web application with Mojolicious. OR Show me how to use PDL to do some fancy data-related thing.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a good week and a happy new year!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Happy Birthday Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as it was celebrated on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;December 18th&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It falls in the middle of festive season, making it easy to miss it. However, there are some &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans, who make sure it is celebrated with full energy. I came across a very interesting &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.beginners.narkive.com/awGuE6yz/geeky-way-to-wish-happy-birthday-through-perl&#x22;&#x3E;post talking about a geek way to wish Happy Birthday&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Speaking of celebrations, the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-23.html&#x22;&#x3E;Day 23&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; featured a proposal for the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; logo. Thank you, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for taking the discussion to a conclusion. We&#x27;ve had many discussions in the past but nothing came out of them. I am very happy to finally have a logo that represents the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; language. It is also a universal truth, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Camel&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; can&#x27;t be separated.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;By the way, did you know that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; announced the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/white-camel-2024&#x22;&#x3E;White Camel Award 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E; few days ago? &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; finally joined the club, though a bit late but never mind. Thank you, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for choosing the best. For those who don&#x27;t know, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, is the person behind the successfull running of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2024/index.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Although each day presents an interesting and thoughtfull topic but my personal favourite is the live session with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Randal Schwartz&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was lucky enough to attend the live event. The timing was perfect for me (London) around &#x3C;strong&#x3E;11 pm&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Don&#x27;t worry if you missed it, be sure to checkout out: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-19.html&#x22;&#x3E;Half My Life with Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On &#x3C;strong&#x3E;December 18th&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the first &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Community Conference 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was held as a hybrid in-person-and-online event. I didn&#x27;t get to attend it but I &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2024/12/pcc-winter-24-follow-up---future-plans-announced.html&#x22;&#x3E;read&#x3C;/a&#x3E; it was well attended. Congratulations to everyone for the successfull event. The recently concluded &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Workshop 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2024/12/london-perl-raku-workshop-2025-2024-feedback.html&#x22;&#x3E;feedback report&#x3C;/a&#x3E; has been shared by the organisers. We are now looking for someone who can take the charge of next year&#x27;s event. If you want to be part of the organising team then please do get in touch with them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This is my last editorial of the year 2024, so let me take this opportunity to wish all the readers of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Weekly newsletter&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, a very happy and healthy Christmas. Enjoy and stay safe with your loved ones. I also noticed this is my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;170th&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; edition. It has been a great learning experience for me so far under the guidance of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#699 - Happy birthday Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/699.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not superstitious, but when a camel crosses my path ... I write about it in the Perl Weekly.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;[Similarly | On the other hand] (I am really not sure which should I put here. Both could be right.), I avoid celebrating birthdays of people ahead of time, but I think I can wish Perl a happy birthday already. It won&#x27;t die on us in the next 2 days, will it?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The other day I was looking (again) for open source projects that are also deployed as a SaaS product (e.g &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki&#x22;&#x3E;MediaWiki&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is deployed as &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.wikipedia.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Wikipedia&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.forem.com/&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is deployed as &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/&#x22;&#x3E;DEV.to&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I found the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted&#x22;&#x3E;awesome-selfhosted&#x3C;/a&#x3E; which is not the same, but might be used a good starting point. This brought me to the question, is there an awesome Perl list?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A quick search found me two: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/hachiojipm/awesome-perl&#x22;&#x3E;awesome-perl by hachioji.pm&#x3C;/a&#x3E;  and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/uhub/awesome-perl&#x22;&#x3E;awesome-perl by uhub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally, the Advent calendars are still on. There are some truly awesome articles in all of them: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://pdl.perl.org/advent/&#x22;&#x3E;The 2024 PDL Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2024/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://raku-advent.blog/2024/&#x22;&#x3E;Raku Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;And one more thing, if you&#x27;d like to have your Perl event listed on our &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;events page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and listed at the bottom of the newsletter, send a Pull-Request to add it to the events.json file.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;And a last thing. I started to have guests on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://live.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Code Maven live&#x3C;/a&#x3E; events. I&#x27;d be happy to have guests who would like to talk about some Perl-related subject. They don&#x27;t have to be &#x27;well reharsed talks&#x27;, they can be just &#x27;sit down and let me show you how to do X&#x27; things. Talk to me if you are interested.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#696 - Perl 5 is Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/696.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I remember when I started &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I used to refer to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl 5&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; just to differentiate it from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl 6&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, which is now called &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Ever since &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl 6&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; became &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I went back to simply calling it &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;During the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I heard the whispers about the proposal of change in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;version&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; but no details were available at the time to my knowledge. Before I talk about it, let me share this &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; repository for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/PPCs&#x22;&#x3E;Proposed Perl Changes (PPCs)&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Anyone curious to know what is happening or in the pipeline, can easily get the update here. Not only that, you can even submit a feature request too. While going through the list of proposals, I came across this proposal for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/PPCs/blob/main/ppcs/ppc0025-perl-version.md&#x22;&#x3E;Perl version&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. A big round of applause to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Aristotle Pagaltzis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for such a detailed document that dives into the finer points. You must checkout the document yourself, in case I missed any important bits. As far as my understandings, in the next &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; stable release the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; version would be &#x3C;strong&#x3E;42.0&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I&#x27;d be surprised if it goes without any arguments and counter arguments. If you ask for my personal opinion, I&#x27;m happy with the proposal. I hope the transition will be smooth.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As we reach the end of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;November&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, two annual events are approaching: the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://24pullrequests.com&#x22;&#x3E;24 PullRequests&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Personally, I&#x27;m looking forward to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cfp.perladvent.org&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as it will be celebrating its &#x3C;string&#x3E;25th year&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. To make it special, there is a planned presentation, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/randal-schwartz-half-my-life-with-perl&#x22;&#x3E;Half My Life with Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Randal Schwartz&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It will be live streamed via Zoom and you can &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://lu.ma/giz69577&#x22;&#x3E;register&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for the event, if you&#x27;re interested.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is also one more event, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2024/11/registration-is-open---perl-community-conference-winter-2024.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Community Conference, Winter 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E; scheduled for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;18th December&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It will be in a hybrid format.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the start of the holiday season and stay safe.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
