<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/681.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week finally we had the presentation about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nE7jdKPEkTM&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub Actions for Perl projects - Continuous Integration&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Watch the video, click on thumbs up, and follow the channel! If you are looking for more real-world examples check out the listings on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. There you can see which CPAN distribution has GitHub Actions configured and which one does not. You can look at the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/recent&#x22;&#x3E;recently uploaded distributions&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/river&#x22;&#x3E;most central distributions&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or the distributions &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/author/&#x22;&#x3E;by author&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The next event will be in 3 days about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301871765/&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub Pages for Perl developers&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. We will start creating a simple static site using just Markdown and no Perl. Then we&#x27;ll see a few examples how to build web sites on Github pages using Perl. Among the examples we&#x27;ll see how the web site of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Weekly&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.theplanetarium.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl Planetarium&#x3C;/a&#x3E; are generated. We&#x27;ll also take a look at some other sites, such as &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://kantoniko.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Kantoniko&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, the Ladino (aka. Judaeo Spanish) dictionary I have been working on. It is using Python, but the same concept could have been implemented in Perl as well. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301871765/&#x22;&#x3E;Join us live&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, ask questions, and get started immediately!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the meantime, there are a few articles, some interesting discussion and the results of the Weekly Challange to entertain you!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a nice week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#680 - Advent Calendar</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/680.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I know we still have &#x3C;strong&#x3E;4 months&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; before the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; season kicks in but I noticed the ground work has already started by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; with the announcement of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cfp.perladvent.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Call for Papers for the 2024 Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. The &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CFP&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is open until midnight on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Friday September 30th EST&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I would like to request all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans to share their fun encounter with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as an article for the upcoming &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have already submitted my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/issues/425&#x22;&#x3E;proposal&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and keeping my fingers crossed. While talking about, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I would love to see &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dancer2 Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to come back with full force. If I remember correctly, we didn&#x27;t have the complete calendar last year. Being &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dancer2&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fan, I would really want it to get back to its peak. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is one of those who uses &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dancer2&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for building applications. In the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2024/08/deploying-dancer-apps-addendum&#x22;&#x3E;recent post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, he shared his experience about deploying &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dancer Apps&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Even my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://manwar.org&#x22;&#x3E;personal website&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dancer2 REST API&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; application.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It&#x27;s a bit late to share but better late than never. We have the monthly post about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/what-s-new-on-cpan-june-2024&#x22;&#x3E;What&#x27;s new on CPAN - June 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mathew Korica&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Kudos for the effort and thanks for keeping the tradition alive.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#679 - Perl is like...</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/679.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Analogies can be very useful to describe a lesser known thing by some commonly known thing, but if your readers don&#x27;t know what is the dying Pontiac then maybe it is mostly confusing. For example I immediately thought about two things: the famous cruiser the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_battleship_Potemkin&#x22;&#x3E;Potemkin&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potomac_River&#x22;&#x3E;Potomac river&#x3C;a&#x3E;. Neither of those seem to be related. Apparently the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontiac_(automobile)&#x22;&#x3E;Pontiac&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is a car brand primarily sold in North America. You can also search for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&#x26;q=dying+pontiac&#x26;ia=web&#x22;&#x3E;dying Pontiac&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but after seeing the results I got really confused.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anyway, the discussions, both about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1ecjhfh/is_perl_the_dying_pontiac/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl being the Pontiac dying&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1ed8m08/perl_is_a_plugin_hybrid_and_not_a_dying_pontiac/&#x22;&#x3E;maybe not&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1eddi9n/dbixclass_has_not_been_updated_for_over_two_years/&#x22;&#x3E;(lack of) maintenance of DBIx::Class&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and in general the problem with Open Source projects were very interesting. I recommend you read them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On a somewhat related topic the results of the 2024 &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology/&#x22;&#x3E;Stack Overflow Survey&#x3C;/a&#x3E; were published. Perl is pretty low on the popularity list. Which ties back to the discussion. Is it important (for you) that the technology you use is popular? Does it have an impact on your ability to do whatever you want to or have to do? For example for me it is important as I mostly teach the technologies.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Let me use this opportunity to mention that in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/&#x22;&#x3E;Code Mavens&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Meetup group I organize virtual presentations mostly about Rust, Python, and Perl. You are invited to join the group and join some of the live presentations.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#678 - Perl Steering Council</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/678.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The release of latest version of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; kicked the process to elect new &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Steering Council&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am happy to see the return of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Philippe Bruhat&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Graham Knop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to the fold alongwith the new member &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Aristotle Pagaltzis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I would like to take this opportunity to thank, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for the quality contributions. Thanks to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PSC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, we get regular updates about the work being carried out. If you are interested to know more about it then there is handy website, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://psc.perlhacks.com&#x22;&#x3E;https://psc.perlhacks.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, created by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As you all know we had big release &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.40&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; last month and here in one month we have two more relases &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/release/BOOK/perl-5.41.1/view/pod/perl5410delta.pod&#x22;&#x3E;Perl v5.41.0&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/release/ETHER/perl-5.41.2/view/pod/perl5411delta.pod&#x22;&#x3E;Perl v5.41.1&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you checkout the changes in the last two releases, you will find mostly updates to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Modules&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Pragmata&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. For me, the most significant change is the addition of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;chdir&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as a subroutine to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CORE::&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; namespace.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is another &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/22405&#x22;&#x3E;big change&#x3C;/a&#x3E; proposed by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; about allowing &#x3C;strong&#x3E;can()&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to take a list of methods. Having checked the discussion, it seems to have closed without merge unfortunately.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have you played with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Bitcoin&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;? Well I haven&#x27;t yet but will do soon when I find spare time. For now, if you are interested to learn more about it from the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; perlspective, we got 2-part series, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023/2023-12-02.html&#x22;&#x3E;part one&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023/2023-12-03.html&#x22;&#x3E;part two&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Bartosz Jarzyna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; shared for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023/index.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2023&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Once you have finished reading them we have an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://bbrtj.eu/blog/article/bitcoin-development-update&#x22;&#x3E;update&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on development of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Bitcoin&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; libraries.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you create quick one-liner in &#x3C;stromg&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;? If yes then please do checkout this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgTnnzaad94&#x22;&#x3E;short video&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I started watching but couldn&#x27;t finish it as I lost the interest halfway through. I have bookmarked it for now, will come back soon. If you are looking for cool one-liners in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; or &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then I would highly recommend the contributions by the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; down below under the section &#x3C;stromg&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/stromg&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least we have another big release &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dancer2 1.1.1&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; announced in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/jason_a_crome/2024/07/dancer2-111-released.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Jason Crome&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am very excited about the update and to know that it is being looked after. Thanks to the entire &#x3C;stromg&#x3E;Dancer Core Team&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Keep it up great work.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the summer holiday break and rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#677 - Reports from TPRC 2024</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/677.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In case you missed it earlier there plenty of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/@YAPCNA&#x22;&#x3E;videos from The Perl and Raku Conference in Las Vegas&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that you can watch.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is also a thread on Reddit answering the question: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1dzblqj/perl_and_why_you_use_it/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl and why you use it&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;First time I taught Perl was in the year 2000. It was one of the local training companies that hired me, gave me their teaching material, and sent me in the classroom. I remember standing in front of the class for some time that felt ages without any clue what to say. Then somehow I started to speak. Apparently the course went well enough as they asked me to teach again. Since then a lot has happened. I created my own training materials. I started to offer my courses directly to the clients, and I taught Perl to more than a 1,000 people. Both in Israel and in some other countries. It was really nice. It let me travel to Perl conferences and workshops around the world and meet nice people. Unfortunately there are hardly any Perl training courses these days and unless there are some major changes in the language I don&#x27;t expect this to change.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am mentioning this because this week is the first time I am teaching an in-person Rust course. Interestingly, to a bunch of Python programmers who are switching from Python to Rust. I am both nervous and excited. I am excited as I love learning and the explaining new technologies and there is a lot to learn in Rust. There is also more to teach in Rust as it is much harder to learn than Perl or Python.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anyway&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not qualified to give my opinion on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;OpenAI&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have noticed &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; has an opinion and widely respected too. If you haven&#x27;t read then I would highly recommend you please do, e.g. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://curtispoe.org/articles/will-you-lose-your-job-to-ai.html&#x22;&#x3E;Will You Loose Your Job to AI?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://curtispoe.org/articles/claude-sonnet-35-beats-chatgpt-40.html&#x22;&#x3E;Claude Sonnet 3.5 beats ChatGPT 4.0&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://curtispoe.org/articles/building-an-iphone-app-with-chatgpt.html&#x22;&#x3E;Building an iPhone App with ChatGPT&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;How about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; dealing with the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;OpenAI&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;? We have another post, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://curtispoe.org/articles/an-openai-chatbot-in-perl.html&#x22;&#x3E;An OpenAI Chatbot in Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, where you will find the detailed discussion on how you can use the core &#x3C;strong&#x3E;OOP&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;OpenAI&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, we are aware the progress is slow and steady. Having said, there is still plenty of work needed to be done. There is a dicussion &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1dv35tx/how_you_can_help_get_corinna_in_the_core_faster/?rdt=62481&#x22;&#x3E;How you can help get Corinna in the core faster?&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;reddit&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Feel free to share your views and if possible offer your help to speed up the work.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;With the recent release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.40&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, you can find out the details of core ehancements in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.i-programmer.info/news/222-perl/17298-perl-v5400-shows-that-it-is-too-resilient-to-die-.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl v5.40.0 Shows That It Is Too Resilient To Die&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/what-is-new-in-perl&#x22;&#x3E;What&#x27;s New in Perl v5.40?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; released a new CPAN module &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/App::MergeCal&#x22;&#x3E;App::MergeCal&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and shared his story behind it in the post: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/davorg/combining-calendars-59g8&#x22;&#x3E;Combining calendars&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#674 - What&#x27;s new in Perl v5.40?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/674.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Around two weeks ago, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;9th June 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the much awaited &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5400delta&#x22;&#x3E;Perl v5.40&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was released. As always, the production release was packed with cool core enhancements. Thanks to the entire team of volunteers who worked day in day out to get the latest release smoothly. I would like to share my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Top #5&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; core enhancements as below:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;ul&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v540/class.pl&#x22;&#x3E;New __CLASS__ keyword&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v540/class-reader.pl&#x22;&#x3E;:reader attribute for field variables&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v540/xor.pl&#x22;&#x3E;New ^^ logical xor operator&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v540/try-catch.pl&#x22;&#x3E;try/catch feature no longer experimental&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;li&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets/blob/main/v540/for-list.pl&#x22;&#x3E;for iterating over multiple values at a time is no longer experimental&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/li&#x3E;&#x3C;/ul&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Day 1&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2024 in Las Vegas&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. The entire day is dedicated for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hackathon&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The main attraction of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Day 2&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is going to be the keynote talk by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Damian Conway&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Who is your favourite &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc2024.sched.com/directory/speakers?iframe=no&#x22;&#x3E;speakers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; at the event? I am looking forward to the talk by work colleague, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc2024.sched.com/speaker/simbabque?iframe=no&#x22;&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. There is another speaker I am looking forward to, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc2024.sched.com/speaker/ingydotnet?iframe=no&#x22;&#x3E;Ingy d&#xF6;t Net&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, who is scheduled to talk about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;YAMLScript&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Clojure&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There is another talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc2024.sched.com/event/1dGtK/build-a-better-readme&#x22;&#x3E;Build a better README&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, is one of my favourites by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Jason Crome&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. A recent post, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://yamlscript.org/posts/jun-20-2024&#x22;&#x3E;Dr. StrangeYAML or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the LLM&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ingy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is not to be missed. If you like playing with &#x3C;string&#x3E;LLM&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then this is your friend.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#673 - One week till the Perl and Raku conference</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/673.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We had our first virtual event a couple of days ago. I was really happy to see that more than 25 people joined. We also have the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://youtu.be/mh9kx-Swx74&#x22;&#x3E;video recordings of Getting started with Docker for Perl developers&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Please watch, click on the thumbs-up and follow the channel!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The next such event will be on 14 July about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens/events/301413566/&#x22;&#x3E;Continuous Integration (CI): GitHub Actions for Perl Projects&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I&#x27;d like to encourage you to register to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.meetup.com/code-mavens&#x22;&#x3E;Code-Mavens group&#x3C;/a&#x3E; an to the event itself. I would be also happy to get requests for topics to cover.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;events page of the Perl Weekly&#x3C;/a&#x3E; you can now see all the Perl-related events we know about. It also features a calendar you can add to Google calendar or whatever other program you use to see the events along with your own events.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The closest of all those events is &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku conference&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that starts a week from today. It is still not too late to register and to use it as an excuse to go to Las Vegas... You could, of course also sponsor the conference...&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Another one of the big in-person events is the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/&#x22;&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Workshop&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that will take place in October. There you still have time to submit a talk proposal or to offer your sponsorship.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E; ... to celebrate the release of Perl v5.40.&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;To be honest, I have been watching the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for the updates almost every day for the last one week. The wait was over finally on Sunday late evening UK time. You can certainly take a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org/perl5400delta&#x22;&#x3E;closer look&#x3C;/a&#x3E; if you want. I am going to install the latest bundle in the next couple of days and play with it. Having said, I am a bit disappointed to find out that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;role&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is not yet implemented in the core OO. I understand the workload on the team, specially &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I wish and hope he gets the support and helping hands in getting the outstanding features done quickly. Reason I am curious about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;role&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is that I am working on something that uses the new OO syntax and I need to implement &#x3C;strong&#x3E;role&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; using it. Unfortunately it has to wait until another big release. Still I am very happy with all other new features. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the entire team for all the hard work in getting the release done in a timely fashion. You guys are doing a great job. The entire &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; community is proud of you all. With all the support around, we will get the glory back very soon.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am wondering when are we going to have the next edition of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;What&#x27;s new on CPAN?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am hoping we would get it by end of this week.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
