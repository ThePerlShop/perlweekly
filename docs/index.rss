<title>#649 - Happier New Year!</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/649.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not big on New Year celebrations so I went to sleep at 11 pm to be ready today as the first action of the new year to prepare and send out the Perl Weekly Newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We were woken up at midnight by the air-raid sirens (now apparently called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren&#x22;&#x3E;civil defense sirens&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, not to be confused with the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(mythology)&#x22;&#x3E;mythological sirens&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.) The Palestinians were shooting rockets at us reminding us that it is still more important for them to try to kill us than to protect and feed their own children. What they certainly don&#x27;t need to remind us is that there are still &#x3C;b&#x3E;more than 100 Israelis kidnapped in Gaza&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. Among them children, young women, and elderly people.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I know some people on this list don&#x27;t like when I write about &#x27;politics&#x27; and even write me emails complaining. Our soldiers, some of whom are fellow hi-tech employees, are literally sacrificing their life in order to protect me, protect us. I think I have the moral duty to use every platform I have to remind people we have this war to bring the kidnapped home and to end the constant rocket fire on our borders. I also feel strongly that I need to thank the people who put themselves in grave danger to allow us to live a normal life. Frankly, I don&#x27;t know how can I ever repay them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some other readers complain about Mohammad using religious references. Well, each one and his &#x27;flaws&#x27;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;To everyone else, let me use a Perlish expression, (finally some Perl content in this editorial!) &#x3C;b&#x3E;bless $you;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I wish by the end of 2024 we will be able to say that it was a much better year than 2023!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your year!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#648 - Merry Christmas</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/648.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Merry Christmas everyone !!!&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This is my last edition of the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Normally it is the time when I look back and recap of my achievements. During my peak, I used to share monthly update and in the end annual report. My last monthly report was &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2021/12/monthly-report---november-3.html&#x22;&#x3E;Nov 2021&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and last annual report was &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2022/01/annual-report---2021.html&#x22;&#x3E;Year 2021&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Reading back, it seems I had so much time and energy. One thing, however, did stay with me is my pet project, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Is there anything to remember year 2023?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There was one high and one low moment for me. Both happened within weeks of each other. It happened when I was at my lowest for a long time. The low moment was when I lost my dad and couldn&#x27;t attend the last moments. It wasn&#x27;t the only low moment in the year 2023. I lost my Mom too yesterday after a long illness. I just want &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to get over ASAP. The high moment was when I received &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://whitecamel.org/p/mohammad_sajid_anwar.html&#x22;&#x3E;2022 White Camel Award&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Also for the first time, I got the opportunity to attend &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. By the way, we have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/whitecamel2023&#x22;&#x3E;2023 White Camel Award&#x3C;/a&#x3E; declared now. Heartiest congratulations to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;R Geoffrey Avery&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, a well deserved member of the community.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do I have plans for year 2024?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I stopped plannings for future as when it doesn&#x27;t happen then I feel low and it takes time to recover from it. I rather deal each day as it comes. I hope and wish it would bring in fresh energy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Talking about events in 2023 that has bothered me?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, I am not a person who shares his view on social platforms for a reason. I must admit I am not strong enough to deal with responses, positive or negative. This is the reason, I don&#x27;t share my views with regard to the recent global conflict. Although, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; never hides his view as it is very evident from his post on various social platforms. I must give credit to him. I remember a sweet moment from the past when I released &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/dist/Calendar-Hebrew&#x22;&#x3E;Calendar::Hebrew&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;23rd July 2017&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I wrote a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2017/07/1000th-consecutive-days-releasing-to-cpan.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;1000th consecutive days releasing to CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I received few comments to my post too. However, there was one from none other than the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Larry Wall&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; himself as below.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;Allow me to also say- and this probably reflects my own limited world experience as much as anything else- how gratifying I find it to see someone named Muhammad release Calendar::Hebrew. Truly you help make this world a better place!&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have known &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; from his contributions to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. He has been supporting me on personal and professional front for a long time. He makes me feel so comfortable to talk about anything under the sky. I always go for his guidance every time I am stuck. I didn&#x27;t know about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; link to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Israel&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; initially. For some it may sound strange relationship between two person with opposing religious background. I don&#x27;t talk about 2 things in public, one is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Politics&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and other is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Religion&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. That doesn&#x27;t mean, I don&#x27;t have a view. I do but I don&#x27;t share on public platform. Having said, I do talk about them in private though.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the break and have fun.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is the birthday of Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you don&#x27;t have an advent calendar just go around the kitchen randomly opening doors and see if there is anything edible... Luckily you can pick from several calendars&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; continues and now there are the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://advent.perldancer.org/2023&#x22;&#x3E;The Twelve Days of Dancer&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as well&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#646 - Festive Season</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/646.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;December&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is normally the busiest month of the year as we get to participate in two events i.e. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://24pullrequests.com&#x22;&#x3E;24 Pull Requests&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendars&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for many programming languages e.g. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023&#x22;&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://raku-advent.blog&#x22;&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2023&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. As mentioned in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/641.html&#x22;&#x3E;weekly newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, there is an aggregation of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Calendars&#x3C;/a&#x3E; managed by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Len Jaffe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/644.html&#x22;&#x3E;last edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of newsletter, I requested for sponsor. To my surprise, I have had few offers came through. It is still early stage of discussion. I am hopefull something positive will come out of it. I am keeping fingers crossed.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Have you contributed to Perl Advent Calendar 2023?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If not then you should and share your real life experience with Perl. You can find the details on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I missed the deadline last year but this year I really didn&#x27;t want to miss the train. Luckily, thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and team, my contribution got accepted and merged. It is now allocated &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023/2023-12-10.html&#x22;&#x3E;Day 10&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in the calendar.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the fesive season and look after yourself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#645 - Advent Calendars</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/645.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Welcome to the new subscribers!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;December has arrived and with it the season of the Advent Calendars. You might recall that Len Jaffe has an Advent Calendar aggregator called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Planet&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you know a running calendar that is not listed there, please contact Len!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It lists the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://raku-advent.blog/2023/&#x22;&#x3E;Raku advent calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and a few more. Ingy dot Net pointed to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://yamlscript.org/posts/advent-2023/index/&#x22;&#x3E;YAML Script Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the previous edition Mohammad sent a call to get sponsor for his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Weekly programming challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Several people replied to me. Those messages were forwarded to Mohammad as that is his gig. However, I noticed that the link we used to have at the top of the Perl Weekly was only showing up on the web site. I added it back. In a nutshell, if you&#x27;d like to spoonsor/financially help the work of Mohammad S Anwar then either contact him or just support him via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you&#x27;d like to support my work then you can do so either via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#644 - Perl Sponsor?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/644.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you or your company sponsor Perl directly or indirectly?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As we all know, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perlfoundation.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Foundation&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, is the parent organisation responsible for the development of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; programming languages. They are also the single point of contact for any donations, whether individual or corporate. Without a doubt they are doing great service promoting &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; programming languages. I have personally seen how they support annual conferences around the globe.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Why am I talking about it today?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I run &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; project primarily focus on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; but open to all programming languages. It was started on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;25th March 2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It has been going on un-interrupted ever since, thanks to the strong &#x3C;strong&#x3E;350+&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; members of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We were lucky enough to have solo sponsor, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.careers&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Careers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; run by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Peter Sergeant&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; since &#x3C;strong&#x3E;July 2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; without break. Initially we had weekly prize sponsorship but later it was changed to monthly sponsorship. The best part was, I didn&#x27;t have to move a finger to find the sponsor. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Pete&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was generous enough to come forward and continued supporting the project for such a long time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Is it time to look for new sponsor?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, we are not expensive to sponsor, honestly speaking. The prize money has been &#x3C;strong&#x3E;50 USD&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; since the beginning. Although I have been looking for new sponsors for sometime but never done anything about it. It is just not my cup of tea. Because of this, I put the code move on hold for such a long time. Ideally I wanted to move the code base to pure &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; solution instead of currently &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hugo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; which is based on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Go&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I also wanted to move away from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub pages&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; hosted solution to a proper hosted solution that we can manage ourself. I could have requested &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for financial help but again I am not competent enough to make formal request. As we are growing very fast every week, it is getting out of hand to manage the contributions by the team member. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; takes lot longer to process the data as some of the team member complained about it too. I wish we had our own repository to manage the contributions.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Any help or suggestions are most welcome.&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not the least, please do remember all those affected by the recent conflicts in your daily prayer. Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#643 - My birthday wishes</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/643.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yesterday was my birthday. Usually we go out for a dinner with my family, but this time it did not feel appropriate, we are not really in the mood of celebrations. Then I realized this year I&#x27;d like you, dear readers, to do me a favor, read my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/birthday-2023&#x22;&#x3E;birthday wishes&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and help make them come true! Please, don&#x27;t send a mail with Happy Birthday in it unless you read my wished and can also comment on them. Thank you!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I mentioned earlier that I struggle finding Perl-related content to include. Last week I looked more thoroughly at the content of what Mohammad sent and I had to realize that the vast majority of the posts are in the &#x3C;b&#x3E;Weekly challenge&#x3C;/b&#x3E; section. There are hardly any other posts. So I was happy to receive a request from Roy Schestowitz to mention the article about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://news.tuxmachines.org/n/2023/11/11/A_Perl_Based_Static_Site_and_Gemini_Capsule_Generator_The_Story.shtml&#x22;&#x3E;A Perl-Based Static Site and Gemini Capsule Generator: The Story of tuxmachines.org and techrights.org&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In other news I am really glad by all the people who subscribed to my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rust.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;newsletter about Rust&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Is is growing at a nice pace. My other newsletter &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;about Israel&#x3C;/a&#x3E; also got quite a few new subscribers. Even the one &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://izrael.szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;in Hungarian about Israel&#x3C;/a&#x3E; grew. If you are interested in either of these topics and would like to know what I think about them, then subscribe now!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you would like to stick to Perl, then I&#x27;d like to recommend checking out the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2023/11/closing-on-112323-thursday---2024-tprc-science-track-survey.html&#x22;&#x3E;2024 TPRC Science Track Survey&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the calls to volunteer at &#x3C;b&#x3E;FOSDEM&#x3C;/b&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Have you uploaded a module to CPAN?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If yes then you will have come across &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PAUSE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. One of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PAUSE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; admins, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, has written handful of blog posts to help anyone understand the internals. I would recommend you start with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://neilb.org/2014/03/11/uploading-01.html&#x22;&#x3E;What happens when you upload to CPAN?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I have seen beginners fighting with issues related to versioning. You should checkout one more cool post: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://neilb.org/2013/07/16/version-numbers.html&#x22;&#x3E;Semantic Version&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you want more?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; If yes there here is one more post on the same subject by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2016/12/version-numbers&#x22;&#x3E;Version Numbers&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;During the research, I found an &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/neil-bowers&#x22;&#x3E;interview&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; with the chief editor &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I really enjoyed watching it after a long time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How do you debug your Perl script?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I belong to old school and still today use the command line switch &#x3C;strong&#x3E;-d&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for debugging. I know there are other ways of debugging. Recently I tried using editor &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Visual Studio Code&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; with the help of colleague at work. Although I liked the visual debugging but for me &#x3C;strong&#x3E;old is gold&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are new to debugging then you should checkout the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtAGbUYTnR0&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube video&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ricardo Signes&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ever thought of contributing to Perl?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In old days (15 years for me), it was really complicated subject. Ever since the move to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, it is lot easier to contribute now. The official &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perldoc.perl.org/perlhack&#x22;&#x3E;guide&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is out there if you fancy. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; written a detailed post: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leonerds-code.blogspot.com/2021/02/writing-perl-core-feature.html&#x22;&#x3E;Writing a Perl Core Feature&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am sure you have enough to keep you busy until next week. Last but not least belated Happy Diwali everyone.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/641.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am sitting in my bomb-shelter trying to think what could I write about Perl, but frankly nothing comes to my mind. There is hardly anything going on in the Perl world. I barely managed to find 7 articles to include.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As you might know &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://lenjaffe.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Len Jaffe&#x3C;/a&#x3E; runs the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Planet&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, an aggregation of Advent calendars. He asked us to mention that if you are planning to run an advent calendar, contact him to be included in his aggregator!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So what can I write about? In the last 2 weeks I managed to work a bit and for one week I volunteered to work on a farm to pick avocados. At least during that time I did not watch news and did not have to hear about the total loss of sanity on the streets of the Western cities and in many of the Western university campuses.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So what am I working on? I have been working a lot on my Rust projects. If you are interested to follow what I am doing here are the instructions to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rust.code-maven.com/subscribe&#x22;&#x3E;subscribe&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to my newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you are interested in my point of view about what&#x27;s going on in Israel and what&#x27;s going on in the world about &#x27;the conflict&#x27;, I have another newsletter with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/subscribe&#x22;&#x3E;instructions to subscribe&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally a reminder: if you&#x27;d like to see more Perl-related content in the Perl Weekly, then write more!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#640 - Perl Workshop</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/640.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I noticed recently the videos of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaDtghjWTaH3CMKDYXcMhCMCNDekVq9iK&#x22;&#x3E;25th German Perl Workshop&#x3C;/a&#x3E; made public. It reminded me sweet and pleasant memory when I first attended the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;20th German Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It was my first ever &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; outside of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I still don&#x27;t know why I decided to attend it, knowing &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is going to be the main language. The best part of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GPW 2018&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was that I never felt outsider during the 3 days event. Infact, at one point, I was attending a talk in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;German&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, a friend of mine, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, sitting next to me translating the talk realtime for me. I even received a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; book in &#x3C;stron&#x3E;German&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; after team dinner one evening. I made many new friends during the event. I even shared the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2018/04/20th-german-perl-workshop---report.html&#x22;&#x3E;event report&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I still go back read it when I feel low.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Why am I talking about it now?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the last edition, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; mentioned &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/639.html&#x22;&#x3E;Standards of Conduct&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.I was planning to attend &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlconference.us/tprc-2022-hou/&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2022&#x3C;/a&#x3E; but then dropped the idea as it was held in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Houston, TX&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. There was nothing wrong with the location as such. I felt little uncomfortable visiting &#x3C;strong&#x3E;USA&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; being a practising muslim. I decided to wait until it goes to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Canada&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. My wish came true the following year as the venue was &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I finally got the opportunity to attend it at last. I had a great time and met many big names. Having attended the conference in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, now I feel confident to attend the next conference in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://tprc.us/tprc-2024-las/&#x22;&#x3E;Las Vegas&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If everything goes as per plan then I would even take my family as well.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How about London Perl Workshop?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Being member of organising committee of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I know it is not happing this year. I really miss it badly. I hope and pray it is back next year. It is not that we never talk about it. We do discuss but nothing has materialised so far. Traditionally, it is one day event, so it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to get decent crowd. The last time we organised was in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2019/&#x22;&#x3E;year 2019&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. There was a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2022/09/london-perl-workshop-status-update-2023.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; last year with regard to the status of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How about Perl Advent Calendar this year?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am so happy to see the preparation for this year is going with full speed. I missed the train last year because of lack of time. But this year, I have booked a slot for myself. If you are interested to contribute then please do &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent&#x22;&#x3E;checkout&#x3C;/a&#x3E; the source. Talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, there is a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Planet&#x3C;/a&#x3E; run by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Len Jaffe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you run &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then do share the details with him. I did share &#x3C;a hrf=&#x22;https://www.lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/2021/index.html&#x22;&#x3E;Weekly Challenge Advent Calendar 2021&#x3C;/a&#x3E; but looks like I forgot to share &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2022/&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Calendar 2022&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with him. This time, I will make sure it gets space in the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Planet Advent&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Jason Crome&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; recently announced &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/jason_a_crome/2023/10/dancer-advent-calendar-2023.html&#x22;&#x3E;Dancer Advent Calendar 2023&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://advent.perldancer.org/2018/15&#x22;&#x3E;contributed in the past&#x3C;/a&#x3E; but this year, unfortunately I will miss it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is the last day for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hacktoberfest 2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Did you take part in the event? If yes then please do share with us. Last but not the least, please do remember in prayers all those who suffer in the recent conflict in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gaza&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. By the way, this is my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;140th issue&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
