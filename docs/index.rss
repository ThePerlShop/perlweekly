<title>#577 - Optimism and numbers</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/577.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;last week Mohammad expressed his optimism about Perl rising again. It&#x27;s nice to have a gut feeling about that, but I would also like to see the numbers. So I looked at the stats I&#x27;ve been collecting for a while: The number of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://szabgab.com/cpan-number-of-visits.html&#x22;&#x3E;visits to CPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. More specifically these are the number of &#x22;entrances&#x22; to MetaCPAN (and in earlier times to SCO as well.) as measured by Google Analytics.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;My assumption is that we can measure well the level of Perl usage by the number of visits to MetaCPAN.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The number for July 2022 does not indicate any (positive) changes, but it is probably too early to see any effects anyway.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;However, looking at the numbers I noticed that there was a nice increase in the activity in 2012. Actually starting in August 2011. This increased activity lasted about a year then the decline continued and by 2014 the activity was below that of the 2011 level.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I could find 2 Perl-related events preceding the increased activity. In May 2011 the release of perl 5.14 and in July the opening of MetaCPAN. Neither seem to explain the change. So I am turning to you:&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What other things happened in or out of the Perl community that might explain that sudden increase of visitors to CPAN?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/576.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Personally I have noticed the fresh energy among all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans ever since the release of latest &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am telling this based on the amount of positive noise I heard on various public platform. There are still few in the pipeline that would give further push e.g. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are interested to know more then please do checkout this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/wiki&#x22;&#x3E;page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; maintained by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/recent&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is another place where you can see all the latest cool &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; projects. I know plenty of volunteers helping to improve the code base. If you use a distribution and you like it then why not share your experience with the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Community&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and submit your proposal to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://cfp.perladvent.org&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2022&#x3C;/a&#x3E;? Or if you have created one then why not share with rest of the world.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you are new to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and needs help then please do give us a shout. There are plenty of help available on various public platforms.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#575 - Backward compatibility</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/575.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;One of the ongoing discussions in the Perl community is the question of backward compatibility. One group of people say it is (one of) the most important traits of Perl that you can run very old code on a very new version of Perl. The other side mostly say that there are very few cases when this is actually needed and the change in the version of Perl is just one aspect of upgrades people need to handle.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Then comes the case, like the introduction of th $00 variable in Perl 5.32 that breaks the code of people who used that variable for their own purposes. This is not the first case where a change in perl (or for that matter in a CPAN module) breaks some working code. Neither will be the last.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So the question isn&#x27;t IF there can be changes breaking backward compatibility, but how we deal with them? Do the authors give proper warning? Are there tools to find pieces of code that will be impacted? (e.g. a Perl Critic rule). Are there instructions how to fix the code that will be broken?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On the other side of the coin, how can a user - a user of Perl or a CPAN module - ensure that changes in any of the dependencies won&#x27;t impact their product or service? How can they notice any impact before it reaches the production system? Possibly even before it reaches the development machines forcing the whole team to stop working.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hint: write and run automated tests!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#574 - Perl Community</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/574.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The community spirit among Perl fans is always the highlight of any event. I am sure you have experience it too. Little while ago, there was discussion to give new life to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Many volunteers came forward to help the project, like, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Adam Russell&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. As we are getting close to the next edition, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; came together and kickstarted the project with a big push. I noticed in the recent weeks, lots of activities on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, thanks to all the volunteers. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; made an official call for papers in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.olafalders.com/2022/07/21/the-perl-advent-calendar-2022-call-for-papers-is-now-open&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I request all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans to submit proposal. If you need any help submitting an article, then please do &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent/blob/main/FAQ-submit.mkdn&#x22;&#x3E;checkout the page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for guidance. I would encourage first timer to come forward and share their experience with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; distributions. I am sure, everyone has few favourite distributions or their own creations that they want to talk about and share with the community. There are plenty of help available, if you need, so just give us a shout.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Talking about revival, recently I spoke about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN Weekly&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, creation of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I shared my intention of getting it back up. In no time, I got plenty of offer. One of them was &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Cheok-Yin Fung&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. She even shared the initial draft that I am currently reviewing. Thank you, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Cheok-Yin&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for the help. The plan is to launch it on the birthday of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; i.e. 18th Dec. I will share more about it soon. Wish me luck.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Maintaining &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; distribution is a big responsibility. I have seen regular release of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/dist/WWW-Mechanize&#x22;&#x3E;WWW::Mechanize&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for all the care and love. You can find the details in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/simbabque/status/1549670503719153664&#x22;&#x3E;Twitter thread&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I know it takes a lot of efforts to keep the distribution live and active as I too have the responsibilities of handful of distributions. Having said, credit must be given to all the contributors who provide patches.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#573 - Pocket money or serious support?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/573.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week Mohammad raised the idea of a GitHub-pages-based central blogging platform for Perl to which Dave Cross added his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/vwb2j1/perl_weekly_issue_572_perl_blogger/&#x22;&#x3E;comment&#x3C;/a&#x3E; pointing out a misunderstanding. At first I liked the idea of Mohammad as way of making it easier for people who don&#x27;t know how to setup a blog, but on a second thought. Setting up a site for blogging on GitHub pages is less than 5 minutes. On GitLab and Codeberg it might take a bit more, but still way less than the whole writing part. If you need help ask Flavio, David, Mohammad, or myself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A few years ago the Perl community got really enthusiastic by the idea of supporting each other via one of the monthly-support platforms. The problem, as I understood, was, that most people received only some small pocket money that did not make any real impact. So most people thought: Instead of taking home 20-40 USD a month I will use this money to support others. We ended up with a circular support in which no one received any substantial support. If you go over the amounts the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/supporting-perl-creators&#x22;&#x3E;Perl related people&#x3C;/a&#x3E; receive you&#x27;ll see that most of them only receive a few 10s of USD. For most people living in the economically advanced world that&#x27;s just pocket money. Manwar is the person closest to some substantial amount, but he still needs more.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This is our challenge now. Can we, as a community, increase his support to reach 500 UK pound? We are already half-way there. If you already support him, please consider increasing the amount so we reach USD 10/supporter! (we are at about USD 5.5). If you are not supporting him yet, do it now:  &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar/&#x22;&#x3E;Manwar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#572 - Perl Blogger?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/572.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Are you a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; blogger?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The state of Perl blogging is not hidden from anyone. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; wrote an extensive &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2020/09/blogging-for-perl&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; explaining not just the issues but also suggestions to get around it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I proposed an idea on my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/cpan_author&#x22;&#x3E;personal twitter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; handle and asked for public opinion. As of today, it got &#x3C;strong&#x3E;22 likes&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I know, it isn&#x27;t big number.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;By the way, what was the proposal?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The proposal was to setup dedicated domain (https) powered by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub Pages&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The static site would be generated by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hugo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It would be open to public to submit blog post as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Markdown&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; formatted page as pull request. After a quick review, the post would be live.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Sounds simple, isn&#x27;t it?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The proposal should be familiar to those who have ever wrote an article for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com&#x22;&#x3E;Perl.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It has the same the process as I mentioned above, I was reminded the same in response to my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Twitter post&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by a friend of mine. It makes me sad to see that the last post on the site was published on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;25th May 2021&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I came to know about the site for the first time when I found out about the monthly post &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;What&#x27;s new on CPAN&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;David Farrell&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. In the early days of my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; association, every time I upload a new distribution, I would wait for the article to see if my distribution made it or not. Some of my distributions did appear in the article, just for record. I even did interview series, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl Ambassador&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for the site in the year 2020. I had the honour to interview, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-gabor-szabo&#x22;&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-curtis-poe&#x22;&#x3E;Curtis &#x27;Ovid&#x27; Poe&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-damian-conway&#x22;&#x3E;Damian Conway&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. What a shame, I couldn&#x27;t continue even though I had the list of high profile &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Ambassadors&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to interview.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have mostly blogged on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar&#x22;&#x3E;blogs.perl.org&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I don&#x27;t consider myself an active blogger, although I used to blog frequently before. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable now a days blogging on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;bpo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, so I decided to blog on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and cross linked on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;bpo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It is (cross linking) something not approved by many as I understand. I am likely to setup my personal blog site instead, just for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I will share the details when it is live. You are all welcome to contribute.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am up for new ideas and suggestions too. Please do share if you have one.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#571 - Sponsoring TPF or individuals</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/571.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What if you had a steady income of a few thousand USDs just for doing awesome things for Perl so you can afford to do whatever you want? I bet there would be tons of things you could do. Improving CPAN modules, patching Perl, writing articles, recording videos, encouraging others to write more. etc.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So what if we could support a few people to do just that? How could you be part of it? You could &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlfoundation.org/donate&#x22;&#x3E;donate to TPF&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, but for you, as an individual it might be better to support an individual directly. Without the organizational overhead. For this a while ago I put together the list of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/supporting-perl-creators&#x22;&#x3E;all the Perl-related people&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I knew about at that time, who are accepting donations. They are mostly looking for monthly support instead of a one-time support. In my opinion it is much better to support someone with $10/month than $200 one-time donation. Partially because having a steady income is much better than having the need to raise more funds every few weeks or even every few months. With that said both at Patreon and GitHub Sponsors you can subscribe to a regular donation and then, after the payment you can cancel it. Effectively providing a one-time donation.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I went over the list now. There are 11 people listed on that page with a total of 139 sponsors. (There is probably some overlap the same person sponsoring more than one &#x27;creator&#x27;.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Personally I&#x27;d recommend you &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;sponsor the work of Mohammad&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as he both creates code and generates a lot of publicity for Perl, but if you decide to support someone else from the list that&#x27;s awesome too. If you find donate to someone who is not in this list yet, and if they agree, feel free to send a PR to add them to the list.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#570 - CPAN Weekly</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/570.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I noticed a fresh air and renewed energy among &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Hackers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; ever since the latest release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I can only imagine what would be the reaction when &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; becomes part of core Perl. It would definitely help &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; regain its glory, in my humble opinion.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As some of you are aware that I have been doing daily &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; feature series for sometimes now, I have seen so much interest in the new/improved features brought in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. All credit goes to the hard work and dedication of the team responsible for the release. I have got all the daily feature posts saved in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for anyone to checkout. I am pleasantly surprised to see the repository quicky getting to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Top 3&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; popular repostories on my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;GotHub dashboard&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you remember &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://cpan-weekly.org&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Weekly&#x3C;/a&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It was created and managed by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I still remember the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2016/02/cpan-weekly-one-module-per-week-in-your-inbox.html&#x22;&#x3E;public announcement&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I really enjoyed the weekly email. I still have it saved in my email inbox. It is priceless treasure that I don&#x27;t want to loose. So I decided to drop a line on my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/cpan_author&#x22;&#x3E;twitter handle&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, asking shouldn&#x27;t it get a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;reboot&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I got plenty of support for the reboot. Even &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; responded with a warning, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;resist the temptation of do it myself, instead encourage others to take it on&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Who knows my workload better than me. I knew if I wanted to do this just by myself then it would be hard to justify the legacy started by original creator, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was lucky to find a helping hand in no time. She is also member of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I have seen her growth ever since she joined the team. I am lucky to have her in the team. She responded with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 emails&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; so far detailing her thought process. It is still in early discussion stage, I will share more details when we have initial draft ready. We are not in a rush, to be honest. The more help I get the better it is going to be.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;One more thing, I would like to talk about recently concluded, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlconference.us/tprc-2022-hou/schedule&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in Houston&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I really wanted to attend in person and meet everyone. I missed the live streaming of the talks. Never mind, we now have all the talks recorded. Please go and pick your favourite one from the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA9_Hq3zhoFyOpb-U3DMU7OT93dPUdtpE&#x22;&#x3E;YouTube Playlist&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I would like to mention couple, I have seen so far from the list that I loved it and they are &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH5IyYyvWHU&#x22;&#x3E;Taming the Unicode Beast&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lSdBSCkFGs&#x22;&#x3E;Corinna Status, 2022&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. When I have spare time, I will definitely go through each one by one.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not sure about others but I miss event reports by the attendees of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; conference. I remember, in good old days, we would get plenty of such event reports. It used to give nice perspective from the attendee point of view. I wish and hope, we get some this time around. Talking about &#x3C;stron&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; conference, I am sad that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is not happening this year too. I am hoping the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; can be the lucky year for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#569 - Fundraising for Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/569.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;4 weeks ago I &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/565.html&#x22;&#x3E;asked you to support the Perl Weekly&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It got very little response. Then 2 weeks ago I wrote &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/567.html&#x22;&#x3E;how disappointed I am&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Wow, the abuse I received for that. Both on Reddit an in private emails.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The funny thing is that the people who got upset that I asked for people to show their support are mostly the ones who never did anything for Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;However, the really imporant thing is that within 24 hours some 20 additional people started to support Mohammad and today we are already at 50 supporters! I was very impressed. Thank you!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;b&#x3E;Thank you!&#x3C;/b&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In any case, think about this as a fund-raiser for Perl. For many years I hardly saw any fund-raising effort by TPF. This week, to my great surprise they put out a prospectus calling for support. I hope they have the communication channels to spread the information about it and will do the legwork that is need to get the support of the community.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For some strange reason they still mix Perl and Raku. Frankly I think it would be much better to both Perl and Raku if they stopped this mix and the two names/languages/dialects, whatever you call them, went separate ways.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Anyway, if you are interested to financially support the Perl activists, you now have a choice: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/new-prospectus-launched-june-22&#x22;&#x3E;TPF&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, directly &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar/&#x22;&#x3E;Mohammand S. Anwar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, other &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/supporting-perl-creators&#x22;&#x3E;Perl-related creators&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#568 - Perl v5.36 - the beginning of new era</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/568.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A big round of applause to the entire team behind the ground breaking release of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have been following the features of the latest release very closely. I am confident it would be a solid foundation for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;v7&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have you had chance to play with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If not then please do checkout my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2022/06/do-you-want-to-get-started-with-perl-v536.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, where I shared my first hand experience playing with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.36&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have you ever thought of contributing to your favourite language, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A little over a decade, I submitted a small patch via email. Those days, the process was not as smooth as it is today. Unfortunately I never received any acknowledgment. Ever since &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, found the new home in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, it is so easy to submit the patches. I submitted a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5/pull/19853&#x22;&#x3E;small change&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to the core Perl. To my surprise, in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 days&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, it got accepted and merged. It has given me confidence to submit more.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Why don&#x27;t you also give it a try?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least, I would like to thank each and everyone for all the support &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;via Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I received in the last few weeks. I am overwhelmed, to be honest.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
