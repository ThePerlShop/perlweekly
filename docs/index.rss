<title>#595 - Happy Hanukkah - Merry Christmas</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/595.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yesterday was the 35th birthday of Perl. Congratulation to Larry Wall!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is the 1st day of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanukkah&#x22;&#x3E;Hanukkah&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, commemorating the Maccabean revolt agains the Seleucid (Greek) Empire when the Jews recovered Jerusalem roughly 2200 years ago. When I go for my daily stroll, I often pass by some archeological digging from that era. We lit the first candle yesterday night.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In a few days the Christian world will celebrate Christmas, the birth of Yeshua (commonly known as Jesus) roughtly 164 years later. Both events are celebrated by lights and way too much food.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two weeks ago I wrote extensively about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/&#x22;&#x3E;DEV&#x3C;/a&#x3E; inviting you to post there and even if you don&#x27;t feel like writing, at least to support the few of us who post about Perl. A few people followed my call. It is still mostly only Yuki Kimoto posting there, but there were a few posts by others, there were some comments and a few &#x22;likes&#x22;. As for me, I publish about a lot of things, not only Perl and I put most of them in series. I have a steady number or readers and the number of followers is also growing nicely. There are more than 400 already. If you too are interested about the subjects I write about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/szabgab/&#x22;&#x3E;follow me on DEV&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#594 - Advent Calendar</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/594.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; celebration begins with the start of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;December&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. For all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans, we have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2022&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2022&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, thanks to the hard work of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and his team. I am sure you have checked out the amazing daily source of fun.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As of today, we have got through &#x3C;strong&#x3E;12 days&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you have any favourite so far?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well I do have mine. To me the best part is the festive flavour in every article. I find it amusing and fun to read the story. I have contributed in the past but never got around to add the spice. I would blame the lack of background knowledge. This year&#x27;s calendar started with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Toby Inkster&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; creation &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-01.html&#x22;&#x3E;Silent Mite&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. What a cool way to start the calendar. If you look at closely all the contributions so far, you would notice a fresh air with lots of positive energy. One name stands out very prominently this year is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Thibault DUPONCHELLE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. His first contribution, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-03.html&#x22;&#x3E;Santa is on GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was a nice way to begin the journey. Then found a gem from a very dear friend of mine, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; talking about good old friend &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CGI&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. In fact, I have seen him presenting the subject &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-04.html&#x22;&#x3E;northpole.cgi&#x3C;/a&#x3E; at the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Conference&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I found another piece of work by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Thibault DUPONCHELLE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MongoDB&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I found the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Day 5&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; contribution &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-05.html&#x22;&#x3E;Catching dreams&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is worth checking, if you want to explore &#x3C;strong&#x3E;MongoDB&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If I am not mistaken then few years ago, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; shared his creation &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/SVG::ChristmasTree&#x22;&#x3E;SVG::ChristmasTree&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was happy to see it part of this year calendar too, not directly though. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Day 8&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; started with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-08.html&#x22;&#x3E;A Perlmas Tree&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Maximilian Lika&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I found &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Day 11&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; contribution very technical dealing with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;signal ALRM&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Not an easy subject to discuss in the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in my humble opinion. Thanks &#x3C;strong&#x3E;OODLER&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for the fine contribution, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2022/2022-12-11.html&#x22;&#x3E;Wake up! Time to open presents!&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you are still looking for more &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; theme fun then I would highly recommend, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2022&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Like in the past, this year also, it has contributions from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; hand picked by me. I am sure you would find it interesting.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am working on something that I would love to be part of this year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Hopefully it would be ready soon. Well I am also working on something similar for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It would be an achievement if I can get both done on time. Please wish me luck.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#593 - Perl on DEV.to</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/593.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I registered to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/&#x22;&#x3E;DEV.to&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in 2017, more than 5 years ago. Posted a few articles with rather limited success: less than 10 people looked at the articles. Then in 2020 I posted a few more articles. On one of them &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/szabgab/tests-are-awesome-3i63&#x22;&#x3E;Tests are awesome!&#x3C;/a&#x3E; I got as many as 300 readers, but the others have not received much love so I did not continue publishing. In 2021 I had another experiment when I published &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/szabgab/perl-modules-with-their-own-web-site-2gmo&#x22;&#x3E;Perl modules with their own web site&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on which there were some 600 visitors. Primarily the readers of the Perl Weekly newsletter. I published a few more articles with readers in the low 10s. A few weeks ago I started to publish again. This time several of my articles got above 100 viewers and one, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/szabgab/open-source-development-courses-5d4b&#x22;&#x3E;Open Source Development Courses&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is already above 1100 viewers. I started to get around 600 readers a day. That&#x27;s already really valuable!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So what happened? There were a couple of changes: 1. There are more people on DEV. 2. I publish a lot more articles that appeal to a wider range of people. 3. There is a sort-of network effect. The more people up-vote and bookmark (the two kinds of reactions on DEV) my articles the more people will see it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The nice thing about DEV is that I can republish the articles I published elsewhere (e.g. on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;PerlMaven&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Code-Maven&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, or &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/&#x22;&#x3E;blogs.perl.org&#x3C;/a&#x3E;), and also I can set the canonical URL of each article on DEV to the original one on my blog. That way I get the visitors on DEV as well, but the &#x27;Google juice&#x27; the articles receive will flow over to my sites. It seems like a win-win for DEV and authors who have blogs elsewhere. You can even configure DEV to pull your RSS feed and create drafts from your articles published elsewhere. I even started to republish the content of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/szabgab/perl-weekly-591-less-than-50-use-ci-4966&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Weekly&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So here is what I suggest. If you already write about Perl elsewhere, republish those articles on DEV and tag them with &#x3C;b&#x3E;perl&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. If you are primarily a reader of articles, then register on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/&#x22;&#x3E;DEV&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and start up-voting the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/t/perl&#x22;&#x3E;Perl-related posts&#x3C;/a&#x3E; you like. You can even follow a few authors there, get notified when they have new posts, and up-vote those to encourage them to write even more.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Alternatively, you can watch the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.theplanetarium.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Planetarium&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It already follows the &#x3C;b&#x3E;perl&#x3C;/b&#x3E; tag on DEV.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#592 - Perl Blogging?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/592.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We all know not many people blog about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; anymore. Are we doing anything to get it back on track? Well, unfortunately again, nothing is happening on that front either.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;But, hey, there is still hope and handful of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans doing their best. One of them is our chief editor, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. He has been running &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Maven&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for years now and many of us benefitted from his work. He recently started blogging on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;Dev.To&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I request all the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans to follow him and like blog post. I didn&#x27;t have the account there before so I decided to create &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;personal account&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Although I no longer blog at all but this is going to change soon. Earlier I used to blog on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar&#x22;&#x3E;blogs.perl.org&#x3C;/a&#x3E; but then I moved to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blogs&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; recently.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Talking about blogging, how can I miss one name, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Flavio Poletti&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;? He has been blogging daily for years now. Feel free to check out his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY&#x22;&#x3E;work here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Kudos to him for his effort.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I would like to mention another name, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, for his hard work in reviving the good old friend, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; has been helping him in the project too. I remember there was a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.olafalders.com/2022/07/21/the-perl-advent-calendar-2022-call-for-papers-is-now-open&#x22;&#x3E;call for papers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by him. If you have time and something to share about your favourite &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; module then please do contribute. I have booked one slot for myself for this year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Hopefully, I will submit my article on time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not the least, I would like to thank all the members of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for creating friendly and positive vibes for years now. As of today, they have published &#x3C;strong&#x3E;3000+ blog posts&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; sharing creative ideas and solutions. If you are interested then please do checkout &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/recaps&#x22;&#x3E;blog posts&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#591 - Less than 50% use CI</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/591.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;One of the best things about programming is that you can get almost immediate feedback from your work. The compiler tells you immediately if your code has syntax errors. Your tests can tell you within minutes if your code does what you expected on your computer. Your CI system can tell you within another few minutes if your code works on various other environments.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the Perl community writing test became the norm. You rarely find any Open Source Perl code without tests. People write test even for code that only they use. Even for code they consider &#x27;toys&#x27;. Yet with CI we are still far from it. On our &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html&#x22;&#x3E;stats page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; you can see that 12% are missing their link to VCS (some of those do have VCS they are just missing the link), but 45-60% (depending on the week) of CPAN releases have no CI configured.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;From experience I know that corporations are way behind the curve in terms of test writing. So I can only imagine how few use Continuous Integration. There is a lot of work to be done.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#590 - Perl &#x26; Corinna</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/590.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Congratulation to all England cricket team fans for the T20I world cup trophy. You played like a champion in the final. Although you beat us (India) in the semi final, still I am very happy for you.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Did you hear any update about Corinna recently?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We used to get regular update earlier and I really enjoyed the discussion about the Corinna. Last week &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; shared a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/OvidPerl/status/1590247361384792065&#x22;&#x3E;tweet&#x3C;/a&#x3E; where he mentioned that code example has been added to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Ovid/Cor/blob/master/README.md&#x22;&#x3E;README.md&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am sure you are going to love it. Thank you &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and the entire team of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for all the hard work. We are waiting for it patiently.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There was one more &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/OvidPerl/status/1591119906510077963&#x22;&#x3E;tweet&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; that made my day about the proposed feature of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; where you no longer need to end module with true value. In my career of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;23 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I have come across many creative ways to return true values in the module. I welcome this change and thanks the entire team.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am keeping the editorial short this week as I am running short of time. Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#589 - GitHub Actions for Perl modules</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/589.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Winter has arrived to us as well. After many months, yesterday was the first day I had to put on long trousers and socks. Tomorrow we might even get some rain. Anyway...&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It is still a bit surprising to me that only about 50% of the distributions recently uploaded to CPAN have any CI configured. Look at the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/metacpan.html&#x22;&#x3E;stats&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and look at the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;detailed report&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Clearly we, in the Perl community, have been spoiled by the excellent work of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://cpantesters.org/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Testers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and thus people feel less need to enable GitHub Actions. On the other hand by enabling GitHub Actions they could reduce the load from the (very few) CPAN testers. They could get feedback much faster. In some ways they could do even do more diverse testing.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I just saw the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/FGasper/perl-github-action-tips&#x22;&#x3E;Tips for testing Perl modules via GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of Felipe Gaspar. There are some excellent suggestions on how to test your module on some special versions of perl and on other platforms such as Cygwin, FreeBSD, OpenBSD. Just to name a few. I&#x27;d like to also reiterate my offer. If you&#x27;d like to get help adding GitHub Actions to your project, open an issue on your GitHub project and tag me (@szabgab) so I&#x27;ll be notified. I&#x27;ll be happy to help and maybe even create a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/os&#x22;&#x3E;blog post and record a video&#x3C;/a&#x3E; about your module. I keep a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/ci-for-cpan-modules&#x22;&#x3E;journal&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of the recent PRs I sent with some comments and links.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The Perl community embraced automated tests. Every Perl module comes with lots of tests. Let&#x27;s now embrace Continuous Integration that runs on every push and executes these test to get very quick feedback!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#588 - TRPF, what&#x2019;s in a name?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/588.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Few days ago, I came across the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/announcements&#x22;&#x3E;official announcement&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with regard to the name change. I saw mixed reaction on Facebook groups for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;So what is my (personal) view on the topic?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I understand name change is not an easy decision, it must have been going on for days if not months. My view is to keep &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; separate. Having said, I like the name change at least it is better than what it was before. Since we are talking about name change, my suggestion is why not change it back to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;Yet Another Society (YAS)&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as it was before if I am not mistaken. Then have two separate board under its wings i.e. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;The Perl Foundation (TPF)&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;The Raku Foundation (TRF)&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Also allow the individual board to decide the path they want to follow. This way we don&#x27;t cross each others path and stay friendly. It sounds simple, isn&#x27;t it? Not sure if it is easy to implement.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This name change brought back memories when I decided to change the name &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. As you all know, right from day one, we decided to have both &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as the main contributing languages. A few months later after the launch, I found the name not reflecting what actual happens on the ground. But I already had the domain &#x3C;strong&#x3E;perlweeklychallenge.org&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; registered and all the actions were happening under the same domain. After discussing with some of my close friends, I decided to change it to a new domain, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;theweeklychallenge.org&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. To me, it makes more sense as we gradually opened up to many more languages, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;92&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to be precise as of today. It wasn&#x27;t an easy decision for me to change the name and move everything to new domain. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; helped me with the domain switch and patch the old domain to divert trafic to the new domain. Everthing seems to be stable now but I still refer the team as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as it is very close to my heart.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How was your experience with Hacktoberfest 2022?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;My contributions this time didn&#x27;t meet the minimum requirement of the event. Although I submitted &#x3C;strong&#x3E;4 Pull Requests&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and all of them were accepted and merged by the author but only &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 PR&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; were counted as the other two PR were part of non-participating repositories. Having said, I am happy many of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; members got more than &#x3C;strong&#x3E;4 Pull Requests&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; this time. Congratulations &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#587 - Continuous Integration for Perl modules</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/587.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For years Perl was a long way ahead of the other languages in terms of testing the modules. The volunteers of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://cpantesters.org/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Testers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; provide an excellent service. Every time a new module or a new version of an older module is uploaded to CPAN (via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://pause.perl.org/&#x22;&#x3E;PAUSE&#x3C;/a&#x3E;) within days and sometimes even within hours the CPAN Testers would download the new release, test it on their machines, and send a report to the author. Sometimes they would even open issues/tickets manually to report the problem and help the author(s) fix them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;These days, however, Open Source developers can use a number of free Continuous Integration systems that would give them feedback much sooner: On every push to GitHub or GitLab. They can run the author or release tests on these systems. They can configure to test other modules that use their module (reverse dependencies) to make sure the new changes don&#x27;t have a negative impact on these users. They can can even re-run all the tests every day making sure that changes in the dependencies of the module don&#x27;t break it. (CPAN Testers usually run the tests of a module only if you release a new version or if your module is a dependency of something that was released.)&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;By catching certain issues before they release a new version they provide a better experience to every user of CPAN and they also take some of the manual work off the shoulders of the CPAN Testers who are few.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For many years Travis-CI was the de-facto standard to set up CI for GitHub-based project. These days it is primarily GitHub Actions.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So, I have been on a quest to configure GitHub Actions to all the Perl projects where the author is interested. I have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/os&#x22;&#x3E;documented some of these&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and I have written on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/ci&#x22;&#x3E;Why and how to CI&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I use the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; to locate candidates, but if you&#x27;d like to get help with setting up CI, open an issue on your project and tag &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/szabgab/&#x22;&#x3E;me&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you like my quest, feel free to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://szabgab.com/support.html&#x22;&#x3E;sponsor me&#x3C;/a&#x3E; so I&#x27;ll be able to allocate more time to this. Oh, and if your company needs help with CI and test automation, I offer that as a service.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/586.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This is my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;115th edition&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of the weekly newsletter. I know it is nothing as compared to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;323 editions&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by the chief editor &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am very happy to have come this far, thanks to all the readers of the weekly newsletter for the support and encouragements. It took me &#x3C;strong&#x3E;4 years and 5 months&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to achieve this milestone.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Please excuse me for the long-winded editorial this week to celebrate the occasion.&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As we all know &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Camel&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; are  insperabale for years now. I still remember when I was first introduced to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the late ninetees, we use to refer &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; books as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Camel&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; books. The association of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; with the big publishing house like, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.oreilly.com&#x22;&#x3E;O&#x27;Reilly&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is mostly responsible for the trend. Having said, there were few others too in the market but &#x3C;strong&#x3E;O&#x27;Reilly&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; stood out among them. But we can&#x27;t ignore the ground reality at the same time, for reasons known to most of all, the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; books started disappearing from the book shelves in recent years. Talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; books, we can&#x27;t forget the service of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Damian Conway&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Randall L. Schwartz&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and many more. Of all those, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; still holding the ground as far as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is concerned in my humble opinion.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you remember the announcement of Perl 7?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I still remember, I watched the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlconference.us/tpc-2020-cloud&#x22;&#x3E;announcement&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Sawyer X&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and was very excited about it. But as you all know, it didn&#x27;t turn out as planned. Let&#x27;s not go there. Immediately after the announcement, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; came up with the book, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/preparing_for_perl7&#x22;&#x3E;Preparing for Perl 7&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, published by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlschool.com/about&#x22;&#x3E;{Perl School}&#x3C;/a&#x3E; run by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was lucky to get the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;FREE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; copy of the book by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I thoroughly enjoyed it as his many other &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; books. While collecting informations for this editorial, I noticed the book is now declared &#x3C;strong&#x3E;retired&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, unfortunately.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Fast forward, in the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2021&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, we got another book, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/perl_new_features&#x22;&#x3E;Perl new features v5.10 to v5.34&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Once again, I was offered the book for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;FREE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by the author. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is new to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; or even if you have used &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for years. I found many new features that I wasn&#x27;t aware of earlier. The best part is the explanation of each features with great examples. It makes it so easy to understand the topic. I read the book from start to end and came up with my own examples of some of the features mentioned in the book. Those who follow me on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.facebook.com/mohammad.s.anwar&#x22;&#x3E;Facebook&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://twitter.com/cpan_author&#x22;&#x3E;Twitter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohammadanwar&#x22;&#x3E;LinkedIn&#x3C;/a&#x3E; knows that I ran daily feature series where I shared one feature with examples everyday. It is now documented for future reference in the form of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/manwar/perl-cool-snippets&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as suggested by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How many of you have read the book &#x22;Learning Perl&#x22;?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have during my early days of learning &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It was the main source of information for me. Keeping the tradition on, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brain d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; alongwith &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Randall L. Schwartz&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Tom Phoenix&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; came up with the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492094951&#x22;&#x3E;8th Edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. This time, I was offered not &#x3C;strong&#x3E;one (1)&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; but &#x3C;strong&#x3E;four (4)&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; copies of the physical book with free delivery by the generous &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I picked four members of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;(&#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;) and hand it over the book, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Learning Perl 8th edition&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. A very big thank you to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; from the entire &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; members.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you think it stopped there?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, the short answer is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;No&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Recently &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; contacted me and offered me &#x3C;strong&#x3E;50 coupons&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; of his new creation &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leanpub.com/learning_perl_exercises&#x22;&#x3E;Learning Perl Exercises&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Honestly speaking, I didn&#x27;t know about the book earlier. I have been giving &#x3C;strong&#x3E;one coupon&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; every week to one lucky member of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. So far, I have already given &#x3C;strong&#x3E;10 coupons&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fan or new to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then why don&#x27;t you &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/how-to-contribute&#x22;&#x3E;join us&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and learn from each other something new every week. Trust me, you will enjoy the journey.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How well do I know brian d foy?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Honestly speaking I haven&#x27;t met him yet but would love to one day. My first interaction with him was in the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2010&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; when I published my first distribution, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::Excel&#x22;&#x3E;Test::Excel&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. During those days, one need to get the namespace registered with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PAUSE admins&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. He is one of the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;PAUSE admins&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; that I happen to interact with. I still remember during the email conversation he mentioned that he liked my distribution and one day he would use it. Ever since, I have had many email conversation with on different occasions. I proudly remember one such occasion when &#x3C;strong&#x3E;brian d foy&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; offered me to do interview series for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com&#x22;&#x3E;perl.com&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I happily accepted his offer without even blinking once. I did three interviews namely with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-gabor-szabo&#x22;&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-curtis-poe&#x22;&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/the-perl-ambassador-damian-conway&#x22;&#x3E;Damian Conway&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Unfortunately after that I got distracted and busy with other personal projects.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Have you tried GitHub Workflow yet?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Two names i.e. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;  immediately come to my mind when talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub Workflow&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. In fact, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; seems to be on a mission to help &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; modules to have workflow configured. Recently I published a new release of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/Test::CSS&#x22;&#x3E;Test::CSS&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, the very next morning I noticed &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/install-developer-dependencies-first-test-css&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by him. I would highly recommend you to take a look at his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlmaven.com/os&#x22;&#x3E;other similar works&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub Workflow&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, my colleague at work and friend, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, wrote a detailed and thorough &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://simbabque.github.io/posts/github-workflow-guide-for-modules&#x22;&#x3E;guide&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on the topic, you really don&#x27;t want to skip it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How many of you have completed the challenge of Hacktoberfest 2022?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;One thing I noticed this year, the pull request has to be accepted and merged for it to qualify. Now even after the pull request is accepted and merged, you still have to wait for another seven days review period. This year, I was lucky to receive the distribution, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/HTML::Form&#x22;&#x3E;HTML::Form&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as my assignment for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;October&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as member of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://pullrequest.club/hello&#x22;&#x3E;Pull Request Club&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. To my surprise, I noticed &#x3C;strong&#x3E;HTML::Form&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is participating in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hacktoberfest 2022&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. As of today, I have submitted &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 Pull Requests&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. That means, I am done as far as my monthly assignment for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Pull Request Club&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. With regard to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hacktoberfest 2022&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, both the pull requests have been accepted and merged, thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. One of them is passed the review period and other is still waiting. Although I submitted &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 more pull requests&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; but unfortunately they are not participating in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hacktoberfest 2022&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, although both have been accepted and merged. To qualify for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;FREE&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; specially designed T-shirt, I still have to find a distribution and submit &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 more&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; pull requests. Wish me luck.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Have you nominated your Perl Hero?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If not then you still have chance to nominate your &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Hero&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Quick and easy to nominate is just commenting on this &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/nominate-2022-white-camel&#x22;&#x3E;official announcement&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and giving the name with reasons. Easy, right?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
