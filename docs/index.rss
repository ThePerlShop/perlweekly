<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Happy Birthday Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as it was celebrated on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;December 18th&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It falls in the middle of festive season, making it easy to miss it. However, there are some &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans, who make sure it is celebrated with full energy. I came across a very interesting &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.beginners.narkive.com/awGuE6yz/geeky-way-to-wish-happy-birthday-through-perl&#x22;&#x3E;post talking about a geek way to wish Happy Birthday&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Speaking of celebrations, the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-23.html&#x22;&#x3E;Day 23&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; featured a proposal for the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; logo. Thank you, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for taking the discussion to a conclusion. We&#x27;ve had many discussions in the past but nothing came out of them. I am very happy to finally have a logo that represents the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; language. It is also a universal truth, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Camel&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; can&#x27;t be separated.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;By the way, did you know that &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; announced the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/white-camel-2024&#x22;&#x3E;White Camel Award 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E; few days ago? &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; finally joined the club, though a bit late but never mind. Thank you, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for choosing the best. For those who don&#x27;t know, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, is the person behind the successfull running of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2024/index.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Although each day presents an interesting and thoughtfull topic but my personal favourite is the live session with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Randal Schwartz&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was lucky enough to attend the live event. The timing was perfect for me (London) around &#x3C;strong&#x3E;11 pm&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Don&#x27;t worry if you missed it, be sure to checkout out: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2024/2024-12-19.html&#x22;&#x3E;Half My Life with Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On &#x3C;strong&#x3E;December 18th&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, the first &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Community Conference 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was held as a hybrid in-person-and-online event. I didn&#x27;t get to attend it but I &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2024/12/pcc-winter-24-follow-up---future-plans-announced.html&#x22;&#x3E;read&#x3C;/a&#x3E; it was well attended. Congratulations to everyone for the successfull event. The recently concluded &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Workshop 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2024/12/london-perl-raku-workshop-2025-2024-feedback.html&#x22;&#x3E;feedback report&#x3C;/a&#x3E; has been shared by the organisers. We are now looking for someone who can take the charge of next year&#x27;s event. If you want to be part of the organising team then please do get in touch with them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This is my last editorial of the year 2024, so let me take this opportunity to wish all the readers of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Weekly newsletter&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, a very happy and healthy Christmas. Enjoy and stay safe with your loved ones. I also noticed this is my &#x3C;strong&#x3E;170th&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; edition. It has been a great learning experience for me so far under the guidance of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#699 - Happy birthday Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/699.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not superstitious, but when a camel crosses my path ... I write about it in the Perl Weekly.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;[Similarly | On the other hand] (I am really not sure which should I put here. Both could be right.), I avoid celebrating birthdays of people ahead of time, but I think I can wish Perl a happy birthday already. It won&#x27;t die on us in the next 2 days, will it?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The other day I was looking (again) for open source projects that are also deployed as a SaaS product (e.g &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/wikimedia/mediawiki&#x22;&#x3E;MediaWiki&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is deployed as &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.wikipedia.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Wikipedia&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.forem.com/&#x22;&#x3E;&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is deployed as &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/&#x22;&#x3E;DEV.to&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I found the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted&#x22;&#x3E;awesome-selfhosted&#x3C;/a&#x3E; which is not the same, but might be used a good starting point. This brought me to the question, is there an awesome Perl list?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A quick search found me two: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/hachiojipm/awesome-perl&#x22;&#x3E;awesome-perl by hachioji.pm&#x3C;/a&#x3E;  and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/uhub/awesome-perl&#x22;&#x3E;awesome-perl by uhub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Finally, the Advent calendars are still on. There are some truly awesome articles in all of them: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://pdl.perl.org/advent/&#x22;&#x3E;The 2024 PDL Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2024/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://raku-advent.blog/2024/&#x22;&#x3E;Raku Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;And one more thing, if you&#x27;d like to have your Perl event listed on our &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/events&#x22;&#x3E;events page&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and listed at the bottom of the newsletter, send a Pull-Request to add it to the events.json file.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;And a last thing. I started to have guests on the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://live.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Code Maven live&#x3C;/a&#x3E; events. I&#x27;d be happy to have guests who would like to talk about some Perl-related subject. They don&#x27;t have to be &#x27;well reharsed talks&#x27;, they can be just &#x27;sit down and let me show you how to do X&#x27; things. Talk to me if you are interested.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As every year, this year too you can check out the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Planet&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://lenjaffe.com/&#x22;&#x3E;Len Jaffe&#x3C;/a&#x3E; listing all the tech-related Advent calendars with daily articles. This year there is also &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://pdl.perl.org/advent/index.html&#x22;&#x3E;The 2024 PDL Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that has not been included yet.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/gpw2025/&#x22;&#x3E;German Perl/Raku Workshop 2025&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/max_maischein/2024/11/german-perlraku-workshop-2025-in-munich---12052025-14052025.html&#x22;&#x3E;announced&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#696 - Perl 5 is Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/696.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I remember when I started &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, I used to refer to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl 5&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; just to differentiate it from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl 6&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, which is now called &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Ever since &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl 6&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; became &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I went back to simply calling it &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;During the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I heard the whispers about the proposal of change in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;version&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; but no details were available at the time to my knowledge. Before I talk about it, let me share this &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; repository for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/PPCs&#x22;&#x3E;Proposed Perl Changes (PPCs)&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Anyone curious to know what is happening or in the pipeline, can easily get the update here. Not only that, you can even submit a feature request too. While going through the list of proposals, I came across this proposal for &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/PPCs/blob/main/ppcs/ppc0025-perl-version.md&#x22;&#x3E;Perl version&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. A big round of applause to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Aristotle Pagaltzis&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for such a detailed document that dives into the finer points. You must checkout the document yourself, in case I missed any important bits. As far as my understandings, in the next &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; stable release the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; version would be &#x3C;strong&#x3E;42.0&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I&#x27;d be surprised if it goes without any arguments and counter arguments. If you ask for my personal opinion, I&#x27;m happy with the proposal. I hope the transition will be smooth.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As we reach the end of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;November&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, two annual events are approaching: the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendar&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://24pullrequests.com&#x22;&#x3E;24 PullRequests&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Personally, I&#x27;m looking forward to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cfp.perladvent.org&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as it will be celebrating its &#x3C;string&#x3E;25th year&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. To make it special, there is a planned presentation, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/randal-schwartz-half-my-life-with-perl&#x22;&#x3E;Half My Life with Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Randal Schwartz&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It will be live streamed via Zoom and you can &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://lu.ma/giz69577&#x22;&#x3E;register&#x3C;/a&#x3E; for the event, if you&#x27;re interested.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is also one more event, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2024/11/registration-is-open---perl-community-conference-winter-2024.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Community Conference, Winter 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E; scheduled for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;18th December&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It will be in a hybrid format.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the start of the holiday season and stay safe.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#695 - Perl: Half of our life</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/695.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A month from now Randal Schwartz is going to give a presentation with the title &#x22;Half My Life with Perl&#x22;. I tried to come up with a clever title for this issue of the newsletter that would reflect that title and I had to realize that I have been using Perl also for half of my life. It is probably similar for quite a lot of people in the hard-core of the Perl communities. Many have moved on to other languages. Some of those still have a nostalgic feeling for their &#x27;first love&#x27; in the &#x27;good old days&#x27;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It is sad to see the decline in popularity. I remember the time when we had several conferences and workshops every year and hundreds of active &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.pm.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Monger groups&#x3C;/a&#x3E; with tens of monthly meetings around the world. Long before Meetup became a thing. Now there are only 18 groups listed and seeing the list of events at the bottom of this newsletter it seems only 3 or 4 are active.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The readership of this newsletter has also declined from a peak of 6,443 subscribers in May 2018 to 4,398 today.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;But not all is lost. There are still people working on Perl as you can see from the grants. There are still people uploading libraries to CPAN as you can see from the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/recent&#x22;&#x3E;recent&#x3C;/a&#x3E; report. There are still some people writing about Perl. There are still some companies using Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a nice week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It has been two weeks since the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Workshop 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, and we are still receiving attendee reports. Thank you to everyone who took the time to share their experiences. Last week, I came across two such reports by &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://leejo.github.io/2024/11/07/smashed_tvs&#x22;&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.olafalders.com/2024/11/08/how-i-spent-my-first-london-perl-workshop&#x22;&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I&#x27;m still hoping to find a moment to reflect on my own workshop experience.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; holds a special place in my heart, as it was the first workshop where I gave my first talk ever. I was introduced to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; by a colleague at work. Back then, there was always an &#x3C;strong&#x3E;O&#x27;Reilly&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; stall outside the theater room, selling &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; books and surrounded by a large crowd. I remember the days when we had three strong tracks running simultaneously and, especially, the last &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; organized by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mark Keating&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and his team. The transition was seamless, and we continued the workshop smoothly until &#x3C;strong&#x3E;COVID-19&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; struck. For a brief period, I was part of the organizing team, but my contributions were limited to promoting the event and assisting attendees on the day.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Bringing the workshop back after &#x3C;strong&#x3E;COVID-19&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was the brainchild of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien Fiegehenn&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Their hard work truly paid off, as the event was well-attended and praised for its smooth execution. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the organizing team for providing a platform to reconnect with friends from around the world. The future of LPW looks bright as I&#x2019;m hearing a lot of positive feedback about next year&#x2019;s workshop, and I&#x27;m keeping my fingers crossed.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#693 - Advertising Perl</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/693.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Throughout the years I had many brilliant ideas regarding Perl and the Perl community. I know they were brilliant because, as I found out later, they were already done by Dave Cross before me. This always gave me mixed feelings. On one hand it was always rather disappointing that my ideas weren&#x27;t new or original. On the other hand it was of a great pride that my ideas aren&#x27;t that dumb if Dave also had them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today I think I can celebrate. I think this is the first time where I had the idea (and the implementation) first.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In a recent article Dave writes about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2024/11/advertising-perl/&#x22;&#x3E;Advertising Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. A very good idea to use the existing platforms to advertise Perl events. As I can see it is exactly 10 years after I announced &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/gabor_szabo/2014/11/shutting-down-the-perl-community-adserver.html&#x22;&#x3E;shutting down the Perl Community Adserver&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Wow, I am rather shocked that so many years have passed and unfortunately I can&#x27;t find the posts in which I started to talk about it so I can&#x27;t really verify the timeline.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In any case, I hope his attempt will be more successful than mine was.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#692 - LPW 2024: Quick Report</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/692.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Conference 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; finally happened last Saturday 26th October. It was a pleasant morning to start the day. I happened to arrive a bit early at the venue and met &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as he was going through the slides of his upcoming talks. It was nice to have a one-on-one conversation with him. For the first time in many years of attending &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I finally mustered the courage to break the ice.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Soon we all gathered in the main hall for the welcome presentation by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I stayed in the same room for the most anticipated talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7904&#x22;&#x3E;Perl in 2030&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. As expected it was an engaging presentation about the future of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. This was followed by another interesting talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7907&#x22;&#x3E;Cloudy Perl, how it looks now&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Lambley&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We took a break from technical talks for a quick presentation by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Stuart Mackintosh&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; who shared how &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is working towards the development of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I had the honour of speaking to him afterward, thanking him for all the work &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is doing to bring the language back on track.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Unfortunately I missed the talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7889&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Diver&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as it clashed with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; presentation. I am hoping to watch the video when it becomes available. I met so many friends after a long time, thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I missed &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance Wicks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; very much but I was pleasantly surprised to meet &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Sawyer&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Cochrane&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We spent quality time together.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;After lunch, it was my turn present, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7900&#x22;&#x3E;What&#x27;s new in Perl v5.40?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It was well attended, and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; made it even more special by sitting in the front row. I mostly stayed in the main hall for the rest of the talks and look forward to the recordings being available soon.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I had planned to attend the post workshop social but decided to skip it at the last minute as I wasn&#x27;t feeling well. I am sure those who attended had a great time. I hope to see you all again around this time next year.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least I would like to encourage you to submit your proposal for the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. You can find more information &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cfp.perladvent.org&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter and please take extra care of yourself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#691 - Promoting Perl the right way and the wrong way</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/691.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Once in a while someone suggests a way to make Perl more popular or at least to be seen by the general population of the hi-tech world.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For example, in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1g6tv9r/the_uri_module_went_on_holiday_but_then_returned/&#x22;&#x3E;this post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; brian d foy and others suggested people could take a bit more active role by reacting to Perl-related projects on GitHub and elsewhere. If you are ready to spend a few minutes on it, you could go to the GitHub repository of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5&#x22;&#x3E;perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the CPAN libraries you use and you could add a star to each one them. This is a rather small task. It won&#x27;t have a huge impact either, but many small things add up.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you wonder how to find the GitHub repository of the modules you use? They are usually listed on the left-hand-side of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of each module. See for example the &#x27;Repository&#x27; link of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/URI&#x22;&#x3E;URI&#x3C;/a&#x3E; distribution.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some modules don&#x27;t have the &#x27;Repository&#x27; link. One of the goals of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; project is to encourage people to add this information to their projects. You could help with that too so it will be easier for the next person to find the repository.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the last week we also saw another way someone thought to promote Perl. You can read about the Unsolicited Email many of us received in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1g4bnx0/unsolicited_email_from_science_perl_committee/&#x22;&#x3E;this post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I personally received 5 copies directly. I replied to them asking why do they spam me, but have not received any reply yet. This is absolutely NOT the way to promote Perl or some Perl related event or content.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Lastly &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/&#x22;&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is just a few days from now with lots of content and with social gatherings before and after!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week and enjoy LPW!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
