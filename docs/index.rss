<title>#652 - Perl and TPF</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/652.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;string&#x3E;Is it TPF or TPRF?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Looking at the official &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org&#x22;&#x3E;news page&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, it still says &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl Foundation News&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I have no issue how you call it whether &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; or &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The most important bit is the work they do to promote &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; programming languages. There was a big news recently as we had the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/presidentslettert2024&#x22;&#x3E;Letter from the President&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. We don&#x27;t very often hear from the President. I was curious to find out what is special this time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I would like to talk about two things, one the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2024 Prospectus&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and second about new board members. Honestly, I never knew about the prospectus. I will be watching when it gets published more likely ahead of the annual conference in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Las Vegas&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the month of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;June 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. With regard to the new members, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Bruce Gray&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Ruth Holloway&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I would like to congratulate both of them. I am confident they are going to be a big help to present the wider audience point of views. It is a proud moment for me as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Bruce Gray&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is one of the most active and regular members of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;OK, tell me how many of you watched the live release of Perl v5.39.7?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;To be honest with you, I wasn&#x27;t aware of such live streaming of Perl release. Thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for this information in the last edition of the newsletter. For me, it was perfect timing, first thing on Saturday morning. I was a mute spectator, just watching the release flow. Some of the things just went above my head but few things I could follow. It was fun though. I would definitely watch the live streaming if it happens again. Just out of curiosity, I asked one question in the end about release ETA of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.40&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I got the response that in the next &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2-3 months&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. That made me really happy as I am eagerly waiting for the next big release. Looking forward to more features to the newly added OO ecosystem.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you use GitHub Actions?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I was fortunate to attend the talk on the subject by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; at the Perl Conference in Toronto last summer. It is really cool thing to have if you have codebase in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I would highly recommend you checkout his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/2024/01/github-actions-for-perl-development&#x22;&#x3E;latest post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; where he shared the details.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Are you enjoying the cold days and nights of January?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Personally, I just hate it as my body doesn&#x27;t like extreme condition either cold or hot. I know I came from a place in India where &#x3C;strong&#x3E;50 degree celcius&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was normal during summer. Not anymore unfortunately, may be I am getting old now. I just want &#x3C;strong&#x3E;January&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to get over asap as in this month we hardly get any sun where I live.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Have a safe and fun week ahead.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#651 - Watch the release of Perl live!</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/651.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;After a long period of time, finally I see a live online event about Perl that&#x27;s worth following. Max Maischein will &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/max_maischein/2024/01/live-streaming-the-release-of-perl-5397.html&#x22;&#x3E;Live stream the release of Perl 5.39.7&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Even if you are not a core Perl developer and are not interesting in becoming one, I think it is an event worthy to follow. It is in the morning hours of Europe so it seems to be more relevant to people in Europe, Africa and the East, including New Zealand.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Am I the only one bothered by The Perl Foundation publishing a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/congo_hackathon&#x22;&#x3E;grant request&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that looks suspicious, to say it mildly? Are they legally required to publish anything that has the word &#x27;Perl&#x27; in it even if the person submitting it has no track record with Perl and the Perl community? Do they really believe that a person who has never contributed to Perl from a place that has not seen any Perl contribution will out of the blue run a Perl Hackathon? Or is this a political agenda?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Speaking of sponsorship. In the last few years the Perl Weekly had some income from job ads. Unfortunately that ended in December. I used to use some of the money to sponsor Mohammad, but unfortunately I had to stop that. So I&#x27;d like to ask you to step up, open your purse, and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar/&#x22;&#x3E;support Mohammad&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. He is running &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and about 3/4 of the Perl Weekly. I think it would be important to make him feel appreciated and valued in this way as well.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;And as for me, I keep &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rust.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;writing about Rust&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I just bought a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://microbit.org/&#x22;&#x3E;micro:bit&#x3C;/a&#x3E; thingy to experiment a bit with light-weight embedded programming.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#650 - Perl in 2024</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/650.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;What is in for Perl in 2024?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We had a big release &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl v5.38&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; last year, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;July 3, 2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It was the first release introducing &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; into core. Although it was good enough for starter but I am looking for another push in the next release in the year 2024. I am sure you must have tried the new OO in core. One thing that I really wanted was the ability to create a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;role&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; using new shiny OO. I have no idea what is in the plan for the next release. I am looking forward to another update to the new OO ecosystem.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Personally, I am also looking forward to the next &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl and Raku Conference in Las Vegas&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I had a wonderful experience last year in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Canada&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I hope things get back to normal before the event. I don&#x27;t know about the conference in Europe. I missed it last year as it clashed with my India visit. It used to be my only opportunity to meet fellow &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; friends. I miss the local event, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl Workshop&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I hope it gets fresh boost this year.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;My pet project, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; recently completed &#x3C;strong&#x3E;250 weeks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It has been a great learning experience for me personally. I was introduced to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Python&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Thanks to the team members we get regular blog posts talking about magical &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; code. Talking about blog post, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, invites us to join the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://wundersolutions-com.eo.page/k22w4&#x22;&#x3E;newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I have accepted his invitation. How about you?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Stay safe and enjoy rest of the week.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#649 - Happier New Year!</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/649.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am not big on New Year celebrations so I went to sleep at 11 pm to be ready today as the first action of the new year to prepare and send out the Perl Weekly Newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;We were woken up at midnight by the air-raid sirens (now apparently called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_defense_siren&#x22;&#x3E;civil defense sirens&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, not to be confused with the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siren_(mythology)&#x22;&#x3E;mythological sirens&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.) The Palestinians were shooting rockets at us reminding us that it is still more important for them to try to kill us than to protect and feed their own children. What they certainly don&#x27;t need to remind us is that there are still &#x3C;b&#x3E;more than 100 Israelis kidnapped in Gaza&#x3C;/b&#x3E;. Among them children, young women, and elderly people.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I know some people on this list don&#x27;t like when I write about &#x27;politics&#x27; and even write me emails complaining. Our soldiers, some of whom are fellow hi-tech employees, are literally sacrificing their life in order to protect me, protect us. I think I have the moral duty to use every platform I have to remind people we have this war to bring the kidnapped home and to end the constant rocket fire on our borders. I also feel strongly that I need to thank the people who put themselves in grave danger to allow us to live a normal life. Frankly, I don&#x27;t know how can I ever repay them.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some other readers complain about Mohammad using religious references. Well, each one and his &#x27;flaws&#x27;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;To everyone else, let me use a Perlish expression, (finally some Perl content in this editorial!) &#x3C;b&#x3E;bless $you;&#x3C;/b&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I wish by the end of 2024 we will be able to say that it was a much better year than 2023!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your year!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#648 - Merry Christmas</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/648.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Merry Christmas everyone !!!&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;This is my last edition of the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Normally it is the time when I look back and recap of my achievements. During my peak, I used to share monthly update and in the end annual report. My last monthly report was &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2021/12/monthly-report---november-3.html&#x22;&#x3E;Nov 2021&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and last annual report was &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2022/01/annual-report---2021.html&#x22;&#x3E;Year 2021&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Reading back, it seems I had so much time and energy. One thing, however, did stay with me is my pet project, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Is there anything to remember year 2023?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There was one high and one low moment for me. Both happened within weeks of each other. It happened when I was at my lowest for a long time. The low moment was when I lost my dad and couldn&#x27;t attend the last moments. It wasn&#x27;t the only low moment in the year 2023. I lost my Mom too yesterday after a long illness. I just want &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2023&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; to get over ASAP. The high moment was when I received &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://whitecamel.org/p/mohammad_sajid_anwar.html&#x22;&#x3E;2022 White Camel Award&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Also for the first time, I got the opportunity to attend &#x3C;strong&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference in Toronto&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. By the way, we have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/whitecamel2023&#x22;&#x3E;2023 White Camel Award&#x3C;/a&#x3E; declared now. Heartiest congratulations to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;R Geoffrey Avery&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, a well deserved member of the community.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do I have plans for year 2024?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I stopped plannings for future as when it doesn&#x27;t happen then I feel low and it takes time to recover from it. I rather deal each day as it comes. I hope and wish it would bring in fresh energy.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Talking about events in 2023 that has bothered me?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, I am not a person who shares his view on social platforms for a reason. I must admit I am not strong enough to deal with responses, positive or negative. This is the reason, I don&#x27;t share my views with regard to the recent global conflict. Although, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; never hides his view as it is very evident from his post on various social platforms. I must give credit to him. I remember a sweet moment from the past when I released &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/dist/Calendar-Hebrew&#x22;&#x3E;Calendar::Hebrew&#x3C;/a&#x3E; on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;23rd July 2017&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I wrote a &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/mohammad_s_anwar/2017/07/1000th-consecutive-days-releasing-to-cpan.html&#x22;&#x3E;blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;1000th consecutive days releasing to CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I received few comments to my post too. However, there was one from none other than the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Larry Wall&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; himself as below.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;&#x22;Allow me to also say- and this probably reflects my own limited world experience as much as anything else- how gratifying I find it to see someone named Muhammad release Calendar::Hebrew. Truly you help make this world a better place!&#x22;&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I have known &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; from his contributions to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. He has been supporting me on personal and professional front for a long time. He makes me feel so comfortable to talk about anything under the sky. I always go for his guidance every time I am stuck. I didn&#x27;t know about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; link to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Israel&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; initially. For some it may sound strange relationship between two person with opposing religious background. I don&#x27;t talk about 2 things in public, one is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Politics&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and other is &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Religion&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. That doesn&#x27;t mean, I don&#x27;t have a view. I do but I don&#x27;t share on public platform. Having said, I do talk about them in private though.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the break and have fun.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Today is the birthday of Perl.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you don&#x27;t have an advent calendar just go around the kitchen randomly opening doors and see if there is anything edible... Luckily you can pick from several calendars&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; continues and now there are the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://advent.perldancer.org/2023&#x22;&#x3E;The Twelve Days of Dancer&#x3C;/a&#x3E; as well&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/646.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;December&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is normally the busiest month of the year as we get to participate in two events i.e. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://24pullrequests.com&#x22;&#x3E;24 Pull Requests&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Advent Calendars&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for many programming languages e.g. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023&#x22;&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://raku-advent.blog&#x22;&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/advent-calendar-2023&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. As mentioned in the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/641.html&#x22;&#x3E;weekly newsletter&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gabor Szabo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, there is an aggregation of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Calendars&#x3C;/a&#x3E; managed by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Len Jaffe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/archive/644.html&#x22;&#x3E;last edition&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of newsletter, I requested for sponsor. To my surprise, I have had few offers came through. It is still early stage of discussion. I am hopefull something positive will come out of it. I am keeping fingers crossed.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Have you contributed to Perl Advent Calendar 2023?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If not then you should and share your real life experience with Perl. You can find the details on &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/perladvent/Perl-Advent&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I missed the deadline last year but this year I really didn&#x27;t want to miss the train. Luckily, thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and team, my contribution got accepted and merged. It is now allocated &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023/2023-12-10.html&#x22;&#x3E;Day 10&#x3C;/a&#x3E; in the calendar.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy the fesive season and look after yourself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#645 - Advent Calendars</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/645.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Welcome to the new subscribers!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;December has arrived and with it the season of the Advent Calendars. You might recall that Len Jaffe has an Advent Calendar aggregator called &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://lenjaffe.com/AdventPlanet/&#x22;&#x3E;Advent Planet&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you know a running calendar that is not listed there, please contact Len!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;It lists the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perladvent.org/2023/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://raku-advent.blog/2023/&#x22;&#x3E;Raku advent calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, and a few more. Ingy dot Net pointed to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://yamlscript.org/posts/advent-2023/index/&#x22;&#x3E;YAML Script Advent Calendar&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the previous edition Mohammad sent a call to get sponsor for his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Weekly programming challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Several people replied to me. Those messages were forwarded to Mohammad as that is his gig. However, I noticed that the link we used to have at the top of the Perl Weekly was only showing up on the web site. I added it back. In a nutshell, if you&#x27;d like to spoonsor/financially help the work of Mohammad S Anwar then either contact him or just support him via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/manwar&#x22;&#x3E;Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you&#x27;d like to support my work then you can do so either via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.patreon.com/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;Patreon&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or via &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/sponsors/szabgab&#x22;&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#644 - Perl Sponsor?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/644.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Do you or your company sponsor Perl directly or indirectly?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As we all know, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perlfoundation.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Foundation&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, is the parent organisation responsible for the development of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; programming languages. They are also the single point of contact for any donations, whether individual or corporate. Without a doubt they are doing great service promoting &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; programming languages. I have personally seen how they support annual conferences around the globe.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Why am I talking about it today?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I run &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; project primarily focus on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; but open to all programming languages. It was started on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;25th March 2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It has been going on un-interrupted ever since, thanks to the strong &#x3C;strong&#x3E;350+&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; members of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Team PWC&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We were lucky enough to have solo sponsor, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl.careers&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Careers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; run by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Peter Sergeant&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; since &#x3C;strong&#x3E;July 2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; without break. Initially we had weekly prize sponsorship but later it was changed to monthly sponsorship. The best part was, I didn&#x27;t have to move a finger to find the sponsor. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Pete&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; was generous enough to come forward and continued supporting the project for such a long time.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Is it time to look for new sponsor?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, we are not expensive to sponsor, honestly speaking. The prize money has been &#x3C;strong&#x3E;50 USD&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; since the beginning. Although I have been looking for new sponsors for sometime but never done anything about it. It is just not my cup of tea. Because of this, I put the code move on hold for such a long time. Ideally I wanted to move the code base to pure &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; solution instead of currently &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hugo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; which is based on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Go&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I also wanted to move away from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub pages&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; hosted solution to a proper hosted solution that we can manage ourself. I could have requested &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for financial help but again I am not competent enough to make formal request. As we are growing very fast every week, it is getting out of hand to manage the contributions by the team member. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;GitHub&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; takes lot longer to process the data as some of the team member complained about it too. I wish we had our own repository to manage the contributions.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Any help or suggestions are most welcome.&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not the least, please do remember all those affected by the recent conflicts in your daily prayer. Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#643 - My birthday wishes</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/643.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Yesterday was my birthday. Usually we go out for a dinner with my family, but this time it did not feel appropriate, we are not really in the mood of celebrations. Then I realized this year I&#x27;d like you, dear readers, to do me a favor, read my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/birthday-2023&#x22;&#x3E;birthday wishes&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and help make them come true! Please, don&#x27;t send a mail with Happy Birthday in it unless you read my wished and can also comment on them. Thank you!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I mentioned earlier that I struggle finding Perl-related content to include. Last week I looked more thoroughly at the content of what Mohammad sent and I had to realize that the vast majority of the posts are in the &#x3C;b&#x3E;Weekly challenge&#x3C;/b&#x3E; section. There are hardly any other posts. So I was happy to receive a request from Roy Schestowitz to mention the article about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;http://news.tuxmachines.org/n/2023/11/11/A_Perl_Based_Static_Site_and_Gemini_Capsule_Generator_The_Story.shtml&#x22;&#x3E;A Perl-Based Static Site and Gemini Capsule Generator: The Story of tuxmachines.org and techrights.org&#x3C;/a&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In other news I am really glad by all the people who subscribed to my &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://rust.code-maven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;newsletter about Rust&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Is is growing at a nice pace. My other newsletter &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://israel.szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;about Israel&#x3C;/a&#x3E; also got quite a few new subscribers. Even the one &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://izrael.szabgab.com/&#x22;&#x3E;in Hungarian about Israel&#x3C;/a&#x3E; grew. If you are interested in either of these topics and would like to know what I think about them, then subscribe now!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;If you would like to stick to Perl, then I&#x27;d like to recommend checking out the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2023/11/closing-on-112323-thursday---2024-tprc-science-track-survey.html&#x22;&#x3E;2024 TPRC Science Track Survey&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the calls to volunteer at &#x3C;b&#x3E;FOSDEM&#x3C;/b&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
