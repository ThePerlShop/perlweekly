<title>#692 - LPW 2024: Quick Report</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/692.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Conference 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; finally happened last Saturday 26th October. It was a pleasant morning to start the day. I happened to arrive a bit early at the venue and met &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as he was going through the slides of his upcoming talks. It was nice to have a one-on-one conversation with him. For the first time in many years of attending &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I finally mustered the courage to break the ice.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Soon we all gathered in the main hall for the welcome presentation by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Julien&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I stayed in the same room for the most anticipated talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7904&#x22;&#x3E;Perl in 2030&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. As expected it was an engaging presentation about the future of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. This was followed by another interesting talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7907&#x22;&#x3E;Cloudy Perl, how it looks now&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Lambley&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We took a break from technical talks for a quick presentation by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Stuart Mackintosh&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; who shared how &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is working towards the development of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Raku&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I had the honour of speaking to him afterward, thanking him for all the work &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is doing to bring the language back on track.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Unfortunately I missed the talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7889&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Diver&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as it clashed with &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; presentation. I am hoping to watch the video when it becomes available. I met so many friends after a long time, thanks to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;LPW 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I missed &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Neil Bowers&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lance Wicks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; very much but I was pleasantly surprised to meet &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Sawyer&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Cochrane&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We spent quality time together.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;After lunch, it was my turn present, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7900&#x22;&#x3E;What&#x27;s new in Perl v5.40?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It was well attended, and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Paul Evans&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; made it even more special by sitting in the front row. I mostly stayed in the main hall for the rest of the talks and look forward to the recordings being available soon.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I had planned to attend the post workshop social but decided to skip it at the last minute as I wasn&#x27;t feeling well. I am sure those who attended had a great time. I hope to see you all again around this time next year.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least I would like to encourage you to submit your proposal for the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Advent Calendar 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. You can find more information &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cfp.perladvent.org&#x22;&#x3E;here&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy rest of the newsletter and please take extra care of yourself.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#691 - Promoting Perl the right way and the wrong way</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/691.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Once in a while someone suggests a way to make Perl more popular or at least to be seen by the general population of the hi-tech world.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For example, in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1g6tv9r/the_uri_module_went_on_holiday_but_then_returned/&#x22;&#x3E;this post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; brian d foy and others suggested people could take a bit more active role by reacting to Perl-related projects on GitHub and elsewhere. If you are ready to spend a few minutes on it, you could go to the GitHub repository of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl/perl5&#x22;&#x3E;perl&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and the CPAN libraries you use and you could add a star to each one them. This is a rather small task. It won&#x27;t have a huge impact either, but many small things add up.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Do you wonder how to find the GitHub repository of the modules you use? They are usually listed on the left-hand-side of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of each module. See for example the &#x27;Repository&#x27; link of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/URI&#x22;&#x3E;URI&#x3C;/a&#x3E; distribution.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Some modules don&#x27;t have the &#x27;Repository&#x27; link. One of the goals of the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://cpan-digger.perlmaven.com/&#x22;&#x3E;CPAN Digger&#x3C;/a&#x3E; project is to encourage people to add this information to their projects. You could help with that too so it will be easier for the next person to find the repository.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the last week we also saw another way someone thought to promote Perl. You can read about the Unsolicited Email many of us received in &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.reddit.com/r/perl/comments/1g4bnx0/unsolicited_email_from_science_perl_committee/&#x22;&#x3E;this post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I personally received 5 copies directly. I replied to them asking why do they spam me, but have not received any reply yet. This is absolutely NOT the way to promote Perl or some Perl related event or content.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;---&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Lastly &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/&#x22;&#x3E;LPW&#x3C;/a&#x3E; is just a few days from now with lots of content and with social gatherings before and after!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week and enjoy LPW!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/690.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Happy Hacking everyone !!!&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I hope you are busy contributing during this year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Hacktoberfest&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We are half way through already but still plenty of time left to kickstart if not done already.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;How about LPW 2024?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well it is less than &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2 weeks&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; before the much awaited &#x3C;strong&#x3E;London Perl &#x26; Raku Workshop 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; begins the fun. I am very happy to see the support of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; community in general. It is great to see regular names in the list of &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/sponsoring.html&#x22;&#x3E;sponsors&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, specially my current employer &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Oleeo&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Gold sponsor&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Thank you, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Lee Johnson&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, for all the hardwork, managing the event so smoothly so far. I am confident it would be a memorable event for everyone.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Those who are planning to attend the event, there would be &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7916&#x22;&#x3E;Pre Workshop Social&#x3C;/a&#x3E; and &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7917&#x22;&#x3E;Post Workshop Social&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Please register your details asap. I have once attended pre workshop social in the past as the usual venue is not my favourite spot. Having said, I am planning to break the tradition this year and planning to attend post social workshop. How can I miss the opportunity to meet my techie friends.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Have you seen the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/favtalks&#x22;&#x3E;favourite talks&#x3C;/a&#x3E; list?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am personally looking forward to attend the talks e.g. &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7904&#x22;&#x3E;Perl in 2030&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7907&#x22;&#x3E;Cloudy Perl, how it looks now&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7899&#x22;&#x3E;A modern introduction to XS&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Also my own talk, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/talk/7900&#x22;&#x3E;What&#x27;s new in Perl v5.40?&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am happy to see some familiar names shown interest in my talk. I can&#x27;t wait to present my talk.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I am also looking forward to meet some of my techie friends after a long time. Recently I found out one coming all the way from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Canada&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I am wondering if anyone coming from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Japan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. In the past, we always had speaker from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Japan&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I hope to see the familiar face this time too. Anyone from &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Germany&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;? We will all find out first thing at the registration desk on the day.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;As the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;October&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; arrived, it also brought the dull weather with it. I don&#x27;t have good memory about it. I hope it passes without creating any havoc. You take extra care of your health, specially mental and enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;I&#x27;d like to thank everyone who thought about us in the past year and offered their support! It was a difficult period of time and we still can&#x27;t see the light at the end of the tunel.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/688.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A belated happy birthday to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Larry Wall&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, who turned &#x3C;strong&#x3E;70&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; last &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Friday, 27th September&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Opensource contributions season is about to start with &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://hacktoberfest.com&#x22;&#x3E;Hacktoberfest&#x3C;/a&#x3E; tomorrow. It would continue the whole month, enough time for you to contribute to opensource projects. Although I have registered to be part of this year event but I doubt to have time for contribution unfortunately.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;For me, I am looking forward to the most awaited event, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024&#x22;&#x3E;London Perl &#x26; Raku Workshop 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is happening after a long gap of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;5 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. If you are planning to attend the event then I would suggest you register your details as it would help the organiser to manage the event smoothly.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;There is another &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl Conference&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; that I completely missed and it was &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perl-conf.ru/24&#x22;&#x3E;Perl-Conf.Ru&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. The first Perl developers conference in &#x3C;srong&#x3E;Russia&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;four years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<title>#687 - On secrets</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/687.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last week the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; was about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-287/&#x22;&#x3E;strong passwords&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. This made me wonder &#x3C;b&#x3E;what is a strong password&#x3C;/b&#x3E;? On some web sites the length of you password is limited. (e.g. max 8 characters) which seems to me an indication that the developers have no clue about password security. Actually worse than that. It makes me worry that the site keeps the password as clear text in the database and the field size was set to that number. (e.g. 8 characters). Some places don&#x27;t allow you to include spaces which make me wonder if they are constructing their database INSERT statement using string concatenation opening themselves to &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://bobby-tables.com/&#x22;&#x3E;SQL injection attacks&#x3C;/a&#x3E;.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;On many web sites you are required to use both upper and lowercase letters, digits and symbols. The symbols being a subset of the characters having the decimal ASCII code 32-47, 58-64, 91-96, 126. That is up to 30 different characters. The letters are 2*26 characters and the digits are the 10 different digits. The number of possibilities using letters and digits only is (26*2 + 10)^n  and if we include all the symbols as well then it is (26*2 + 10 + 30)^n for a password of n characters. If I am not mistaken with this and with the calculations, this means that a 7-character password using [a-zA-Z0-9] has more variety than a 6-character password that also includes symbols. In other words having a longer password makes your password much stronger than including symbols as well.  As far as I understand having 15-charcter password using only letters and spaces would make my password much stronger than having an 8-character password using all 92 characters.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;So I tend to use sentences that make sense to me or quotes from poems or from song lyrics as passwords. That makes it much easier to remember them and - if I am not mistaken - harder to find by an attacker.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;What do you think?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In other news Adam Russell, Brett Estrade, and Christos Argyropoulos are trying to get the word out about the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/oodler_577/2024/09/perl-community-conference-science-perl-journal-winter-2024-call-for-papers-now-open-deadline-930.html&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Community Conference / Science Perl Journal&#x3C;/a&#x3E; Winter 2024 CALL FOR PAPERS NOW OPEN! (Deadline 9/30).&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Talking about conference, I would like to share a big announcement about &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/dates_set_tprc_2025&#x22;&#x3E;The Perl and Raku Conference 2025&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It was a big surprise for me. I hope and wish this time, it would be a big crowd puller for both &#x3C;strong&#x3E;attendees&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;sponsors&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. We even have the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://news.perlfoundation.org/post/2024tprc&#x22;&#x3E;action report&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPRC 2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; as shared by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;TPF&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Plenty of interesting results came out of it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Well, if we are talking conference then how can we miss the long awaiting &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024&#x22;&#x3E;London Perl &#x26; Raku Conference 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is going strong as we are approaching the event. A gentle reminder to myself to get my slides ready for my talk. I am super excited to meet my heroes in person.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Last but not least, you please take care of your health. Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I don&#x27;t have much to say today and frankly I am rather tired of all kinds of things not related to Perl or programming. Just looking at the news and its reflection on social media makes me extremly sad.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;

&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Did you just ask that?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; Well just to give some background, it was the project to add a new object system to the &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; core led by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I would highly recommend you &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/Perl-Apollo/Corinna&#x22;&#x3E;checkout this repository&#x3C;/a&#x3E; if you are completely new to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Corinna&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. And if you still have time to read more then you should &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://curtispoe.org/articles/corinna-in-the-perl-core.html&#x22;&#x3E;read this blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by the man himself, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Curtis Poe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Those who are well informed and updated, might ask why am I talking about it now since it is already in core? Well, many have got their hand dirty with the new OO system and shared their experiences. Overall response is, we loved it but we want more. I am pretty confident in the next production release we would have more features added to it. The one, I am personally looking forward to, is to be able to create &#x3C;strong&#x3E;role&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; using new OO syntax. Well again, I haven&#x27;t answered the question, why talking about it now? Last &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Thursday&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;, I went to office (day job) to attend company meeting. I only go when it is special occassion otherwise I work from home. This time, it was giving farewell to our boss and best friend. After we were done with speech and celebration, I was just looking for something to read and I came across &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://dev.to/davorg/on-the-bleading-edge-1olf&#x22;&#x3E;this blog post&#x3C;/a&#x3E; by &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Dave Cross&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was completely blown away the way he articulated his experience with the new OO system. It is not easy to do so, as if you are not carefull then it might come across as negative. I am a big fan of his writing skill, be it his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://davecross.co.uk/books&#x22;&#x3E;books&#x3C;/a&#x3E; or his &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlhacks.com/author/davorg&#x22;&#x3E;blog posts&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Coming back to his recent post, he mentioned few names (I don&#x27;t want to repeat here and spoil your experience) and how they helped him deal with the issues he discussed in the post. I really want you all to take your own sweet time and read this thoroughly. I am sure, you will love it too.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;Are you lazy programmer?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Please don&#x27;t get me wrong, I don&#x27;t mean in derogatory way. We, as a programmer, always look for getting things done quick. With experience in hand, you do get your way most of the time. &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Olaf Alders&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; recently shared a very &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.olafalders.com/2024/08/28/i-am-still-lazy&#x22;&#x3E;engaging blost post&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. In the post he is talking about his toy, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org/pod/lazy&#x22;&#x3E;lazy&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I liked the name, short and precise. This tool is definitely going into my toolbox as I find it very handy and easy to use. If you ever had trouble with dependency when running a script then this is your friend.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Let me share a funny story about my early days. I started as a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Visual Basic&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; programmer. Then few years after playing with it, I decided to make a move in the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;1999&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I was given two choices, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; and &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Java&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. The company offered me to learn the language on the job. I picked &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; without knowing anything about it and here I am editing weekly newsletter specially for &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; fans. I didn&#x27;t ditch &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Java&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; completely to be honest. I keep playing with it as and when I got time. With the project like &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://theweeklychallenge.org&#x22;&#x3E;The Weekly Challenge&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that I have been running successfully for over &#x3C;strong&#x3E;5 years&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; helped me keep the passion alive. A friend of mine shared this fun project, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://github.com/fglock/PerlOnJava&#x22;&#x3E;PerlOnJava&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. Just to give you an overview, it is a &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; compiler. It compiles &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; into &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Java&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; bytecode and runs it.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;&#x3C;strong&#x3E;What&#x27;s new on CPAN?&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Thank you, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Mathew Korica&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; for keeping the tradition alive. It gives an insight what is happening on &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether you have your own distributions or you use others, it is always fun to see what is new added on. It also gives you an overview as bonus. If you never uploaded anything to &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then please do come up with something usefull and push it. And if you are lucky, it might end up in the monthly report. If we are talking about &#x3C;strong&#x3E;CPAN&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then we can&#x27;t ignore &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://metacpan.org&#x22;&#x3E;MetaCPAN&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is one stop place for all &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; programmers. I have seen it&#x27;s growth over the years with added features and tools. Thanks to the entire team behind the project. Also thanks to the sponsor, &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://opencagedata.com&#x22;&#x3E;OpenCage&#x3C;/a&#x3E;, for the support. Someone shared the blog post: &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.perl.com/article/why-we-sponsor-metacpan-opencage&#x22;&#x3E;Why We Sponsor MetaCPAN: OpenCage&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. It is pleasure to see how &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; is helping such a big project. It is worth reading, in my humble opinion.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;In the less than two months, we are going to have &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024&#x22;&#x3E;London Perl &#x26; Raku Workshop 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. I am so happy to hear that we are now 90% full on two tracks. The organiser is now planning to add a third track. If you are planning to attend the much awaited event then I would suggest you register asap. This would help the organisers manage the event better. If you or your company using &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Perl&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; then why not consider sponsoring the event. Talking about conference, I would like to mention the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://yapcjapan.org/2024hakodate&#x22;&#x3E;YAPC::Hakodate 2024&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. This is the second event in the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2024&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. I wish we had at least one in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Europe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Before the pandemic, it used to be an annual event. Last time, &#x3C;strong&#x3E;YAPC::Europe&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; happened was in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Riga&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; in the year &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2019&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. It was decided at the event that in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;2020&#x3C;/strong&#x3E; we would meet in &#x3C;strong&#x3E;Amsterdam&#x3C;/strong&#x3E;. Unfortunately it didn&#x27;t happen, so sad.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Please do take extra care of yourself and your loved one. Enjoy rest of the newsletter.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>

<title>#683 - An uptick in activity on Reddit?</title>
<link>https://perlweekly.com/archive/683.html</link>
<description>&#x3C;p&#x3E;Hi there,&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;I maintain &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://perlweekly.com/stats&#x22;&#x3E;weekly stats&#x3C;/a&#x3E; of some of the sources of Perl content. One of them is Reddit. For a while it seems that the number of weekly posts went under 10, but today I noticed that in the last month or two there is an uptick of activity on Reddit. I wonder why?&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;The &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://blogs.perl.org/users/lpw/2024/08/second-batch-of-lpw-2024-talks-accepted.html&#x22;&#x3E;Second Batch of LPW 2024 Talks Accepted&#x3C;/a&#x3E;. If you have not done so, register now to the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://act.yapc.eu/lpw2024/&#x22;&#x3E;London Perl and Raku Workshop&#x3C;/a&#x3E; that will take place on Saturday 26th October 2024&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;A long-long time the &#x3C;a href=&#x22;https://www.pm.org/&#x22;&#x3E;Perl Mongers&#x3C;/a&#x3E; used to organize their meetings on their mailing list. Then Meetup became a popular web site and some of the Perl Monger groups set accounts there too. It seems Meetup has increased its prices by quite a lot so I saw a number of Perl and other groups deciding to leave. I started to work on an alternative system for myself and for anyone who would be interested to use it. It is Open Source. Although it is written in Rust, if you are interested, you could help. At least with testing. Let me know in an email and I&#x27;ll send you the details.&#x3C;/p&#x3E;
&#x3C;p&#x3E;Enjoy your week!&#x3C;/p&#x3E;</description>
